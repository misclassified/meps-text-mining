Damian BOESELAGER,2023-12-13,EN,Preparation of the European Council meeting of 14-15 December 2023 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-043-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager (Verts/ALE),  blue-card question. – Madam President, dear Mr Glucksmann, thanks a lot for this strong intervention in favour of support for Ukraine. I just wanted to ask, what would you do if you were Commission President now and you had the choice to act and rein Orban in? What would you do?

We have the EUCO coming, and I do want to ask you the question that we asked the President of the Commission this morning, what are you going to do to make sure that Orbán is reined in, that we don’t give in to his blackmailing when it comes to our support for Ukraine, for the formal accession talks? Are you going to take away the Council Presidency? Are you going to push forward the Article 7 procedures? Please let us know your plan about that.

Damian BOESELAGER,2023-12-13,EN,One year after Morocco and QatarGate – stocktaking of measures to strengthen transparency and accountability in the European institutions (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-233-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, Commissioner, Council, it has been a year since QatarGate and it was quite a shock, to be honest, also for me personally, that colleagues in our House would actually be that corrupt. And since then we have tried a lot to improve our rules, and I think that was very necessary to win at least some of the trust back that we lost because of QatarGate. But I’m not sure it’s going to be enough. And I also want to bring us to the title of today’s debate, which is about EU institutions. It’s not only about Parliament, and I think an equally big scandal, if not even bigger, is that tomorrow and the day after, we will have a foreign agent sitting in a very opaque body, the 27 heads of state and government actually representing Russia’s interests when we decide about Ukraine’s future. For me, it’s really crucial that we understand that we have a new gate happening, RussiaGate, if you want, when roubles from Russia roll into Budapest for blocking our support for Ukraine. This can’t continue and we have to work on it. So let’s win back trust by reforming all bodies of the European Union.

This is not a regular proposal that we are making. This is a very foundational proposal that is happening. And I am very proud and happy that I can actually live in this moment where we, as the European Parliament, trying to change the European Union. And we really have to fix the European Union because it is under attack. 
We might not see the cracks in the wall, but I can definitely hear the hammering and the banging of the far right, really trying to undermine this Union as we speak. And if we look beyond this place where we already hear this and we look outside and we see, for example, in foreign policy, Viktor Orbán shaking hands with Putin, while Putin is at the same time attacking Ukraine and killing Ukrainian citizens, it is becoming very obvious. 
When we look west and we see the US again in the grip of the far-right populists, we know that we have to really do something. So I appeal to you, colleagues, to live up to this responsibility, to understand the history, the historic moment that we currently live in and vote in favour of changing the European Union, of fixing the European Union so that it is able to act and live for the next 50, 100, 200 years.

I think that’s a very positive development. From my perspective, the question is really of how we can ensure that we are able to act on a European Union level. There might be examples when other Member States have also been blocking and vetoing things that are in the common interest of the European Union.
But I think what’s core is that we have to make sure that we are able to act on the European Union level. This is not about disempowering national parliaments; it’s making sure that the things we decide on the European level are decided by a European government that is backed by a European Parliament, and this is where we have to go.

Our laws and values are not worth the paper they are written on if they are systematically broken. And I want to be very clear with our colleagues from the far right: this is not about political differences. It is not about having different opinions on certain issues. It is about undermining the exact stage where democracy is happening. And this is not sacred. This is dirty. It is dirty to steal public money and to give it to your friends. It is dirty if you shake the hands of a dictator that is currently bombing in Ukraine. It is dirty if you have unfair elections where you manipulate your citizens to vote for you. This is dirty and this is not politics, this is not democracy – it is the undermining of democracy.
And therefore, I want to thank the Commissioners for being quite strong and upholding the rule of law by cutting the funds and making sure that this also stays the same until Orbán decides to actually be positive for his own people, for the Hungarian people, who are not the same and unlock these funds by following simply our rule of law. It is not so complicated.
And I would also ask our dear countries to review their bilateral relationships also economically, also in Germany, to see whether we have to be even stricter with the Hungarian Government now.

It reduces the positive impact of the EU budget and it erodes the trust that we as a European Union are a guarantor for transparency. So, the work of the Court of Auditors is really very recommendable and important to keep this trust, and it should be the pro-Europeans of this House who point out the issues with the budget. 
Now to the COVID-19 recovery fund. One thing has to be clear. The fund has already been a huge success because it created stability in a financial market situation which was complex, and we have been basically saying that no country will be left alone facing the COVID-19 crisis. So, that doesn’t mean that there are also some issues. When we look, for example, at the repayment, it’s absolutely clear that we need European own resources, a plastic tax, a minimum corporate tax to be able to finance the debts that we had to incur at this crucial time of our European history. 
I also want to make it very clear, Commissioner, that it would be very important that you look at your processes to see where there are issues that the Court found, so that when we set up the next permanent fiscal capacity, we do it with these learnings in mind.

Viele hier scheinen im Hinblick auf den US Inflation Reduction Act die jahrzehntealten ordnungspolitischen Maßnahmen über Bord werfen zu wollen. Innovation und Wettbewerb werden in der EU immer öfter aus den Ministerbüros gedacht, und es wird die Vorstellung verbreitet, dass der Staat tatsächlich in der Lage ist, neue Märkte und Produkte zu gestalten.
Die Kommission hilft hier fleißig mit. Von den 60 gestellten Staatsbeihilfeanträgen wurden 58 genehmigt. Aber das kann nicht unser Ansatz für eine gelungene Industriepolitik in Europa sein. Denn erstens ist es ganz oft eben ein nationaler Ansatz. Wenn wir uns das anschauen, die Chipfabrik in Deutschland mit fast 10 Milliarden Euro, das kann sich einfach ein kleineres EU-Land nicht leisten. Da müssen wir vorsichtig sein. Der Binnenmarkt muss zusammenhalten.
Das Zweite ist, dass ich Ihnen als Gründer eines innovationstreibenden Start-ups in der Politik sagen kann, dass es sehr schwierig ist, aus Ministerbüros heraus tatsächlich vorauszusehen, wie die Zukunft aussehen wird. Und es ist auch so, dass wir einfach wieder mehr darauf vertrauen müssen, dass unsere Unternehmerinnen und Unternehmer funktionieren können, dass unser Binnenmarkt funktionieren kann, wenn wir in Forschung und Entwicklung investieren, wenn wir darin investieren, die Kapitalmärkte in Europa tatsächlich zusammenzuführen und zu harmonisieren, und wenn wir das Wettbewerbsrecht auch wieder richtig durchsetzen. Lassen Sie uns also nicht einfach nur in die Investitionspolitik reindenken aus Ministerbürosicht, sondern tatsächlich eben auch wieder ordnungspolitisch denken.

Damian BOESELAGER,2023-10-17,EN,General budget of the European Union for the financial year 2024 - all sections (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-17-INT-2-168-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, I am sometimes thankful for the speeches from the far right, because then when I think of the exact opposite, I know what I have to say. This is true for the budget as it is for everything else.
A colleague from the far right in this debate said that we should cut funds because we give too much money to Ukraine. The opposite is obviously true, and it makes me absolutely sick to see a Prime Minister of an EU country currently shaking hands with Putin, who is at the same time attacking and killing Ukrainians.
Another one said that we need to cut funds because the corona recovery money is flowing at the same time. That reminds me of the beautiful fact that we had Polish elections, and hopefully soon the justice system will be reinstated in Poland, and then EUR 35 billion can actually flow to the Polish citizens in the dual transition – the green and digital transition.
Another one said that we should increase cohesion funds. We should not fall into this trap. We need common investment in Europe for the big strategic priorities of the European Union. For that, I will support the rapporteur in his negotiations with the Council so that we get a strong Europe, a strong budget to fight for our future.

Damian BOESELAGER,2023-10-16,EN,Establishing the Ukraine Facility (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-16-INT-1-076-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the Ukraine facility is a sign of historic support for Ukraine and I’m proud to be part of the negotiation team.
It’s historic because we sent two strong messages. The first one is that our commitment to Ukraine is long and long term. The Ukraine facility is an institutional design for a long-term tool, that is why it’s so important not only how much we spend, but also how we spend the money. And I’m happy that some of our ideas were taken up here, especially when it comes to defining a minimum share for SMEs, because we do need Ukraine to build new businesses, introduce innovations and push forward the green transition instead of just putting helicopter money on state-owned enterprises.
And the second important message – and I think that’s also key to underline – is that good institutions matter. We’ve learned from the Marshall Fund that good governance, checks and balances and transparency matter, especially in a country that hopefully sooner rather than later will join the EU. We have therefore strengthened institutions such as the Rada Verkhovna, where we have involved local actors, civil society, and we asked for a list of final beneficiaries to be able to follow the money.
Colleagues, I also want to say that reconstruction will need many additional funds. Let’s face it, 50 billion over four years will not be sufficient to support Ukraine until the end of the war and for the reconstruction. But we started by setting this programme up long term, and I am happy that we do that, because in the end – I mean, some colleagues and I, we went to Ukraine recently – what Ukrainians are enduring for democracy is really hard and I think giving some support here is the least we can do.

Damian BOESELAGER,2023-10-04,EN,Need for a speedy adoption of the asylum and migration package (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-04-INT-3-062-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, we do need a deal and we do need a system very fast, because otherwise we will hear this kind of fear mongering from the right that we heard earlier, not even shying away from Nazi terminology. This is something we have to get over. There is no far right party that didn’t rise on the topic of migration and asylum. I think that’s very clear. But it does matter what kind of deal we get, what kind of system we get. And here I just want to say that while I’m happy that maybe we have a crisis position soon, it also matters what’s in that position. And to be honest, what the Member States are currently proposing doesn’t really work. I mean, let’s look at it. Jailing people and children in the camp would have not helped Italy in Lampedusa, nor would it have helped the asylum seekers. Extending the time of jailing wouldn’t have helped. Transferring some cash to Lampedusa from other Member States wouldn’t have helped. So we need to look at the actual system that we want and that actually works. So a system that works would have fast decentralised procedures, a system that works which, understand that we are one union, and that we need to distribute people across the Union to not have borders. A system that works would have understood that integration challenges and opportunities need to be solved within integration and not by reducing the amount of migrants or asylums that we get here. And a system that works would have a functioning search and rescue system, a system that works wouldn’t put anyone in camps, especially not children. We are better than that. And a system that works wouldn’t follow negative rhetoric, but understand that 75 % of people actually getting asylum decisions at the moment in Germany are positive. So let’s work for a system that works rather than just closing any deal.

I also condemn anyone that uses easy populist solutions of saying, you know, the others are evil and we should keep them out. And it doesn’t matter what kind of party family they’re from. But it’s definitely true that every far right politician sitting here has used this rhetoric and even went so far as to using Nazi terminology in this House. And that is not okay and that’s not acceptable.

Damian BOESELAGER,2023-10-03,EN,Interim report on the proposal for a mid-term revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-03-INT-2-027-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, colleagues, we have said that there are many challenges that the European Union is facing – amongst them, a crazy dictator putting tanks into Ukraine and neighbouring countries that hopefully soon will be a candidate, and obviously the global competitiveness challenge due to the overdependence of supply and demand on China and the need to create, massively, green jobs and phase out brown ones. 
But all these challenges need cash, need funding to be addressed, and if we look at what has been proposed by the Commission with the placet of the Council, it is not enough. I mean, 50 billion for Ukraine is a good start, but it will not be sufficient to even cover the pensions and wages if the US doesn’t live up to its part of the deal. This will not be enough to trigger reconstruction. When it comes to a common investment strategy, I’m sorry, but we know that Germany alone spent around 10 billion for one single factory in Magdeburg, so it cannot be enough to just have, you know, 6 billion out there to strategically invest. This will not be good for the single market. 
Let’s get real. We need to address the challenges of our time. For that, we need a budget that is actually worth it.

And what is a parliamentary democracy? It’s not so complicated. If we were just 100 people in a room, we could potentially still decide together. But since we are many more millions of people, we delegate our power to a couple of people to take decisions. To be able to take decisions, meaning I can bring in new ideas. That’s the right of initiative. I can decide on the government that is actually governing these decisions that proposes new ideas. And I can decide about how the money is allocated, the cash, and that’s budget authority. You bring these three points in your report, and I think they’re very, very crucial.
In addition, I really like that you also look into what happens in between elections and there are good ideas of citizen participation that we can learn from. And it should also be clear that if I move to another EU country, I have the right to also participate in the democracy that is there – national elections, regional elections, and of course, the European elections.

And we are very much aware what it means to deal with compliance requirements, trying to find affordable lawyers and fight artificial market barriers.
Colleagues, we all talk and we love to talk about the backbone that SMEs are for our economy. But we really need to look into the details of the laws to understand what we can do to help them. We need to make sure that they do not need lawyers and legalists to be able to understand what the law looks like.
I can give you some positive examples where we have managed to do this. For example, in the Data Act, we ensure that some compliance criteria don’t need to be fulfilled if you’re a small company. And also in the Ukraine facility, we are trying to currently channel a lot of the money also to the SMEs to ensure that we help them. Why? Because SMEs are not only the backbone of our economy, they are also the backbone of our society and they are the ones asking for democracy and for free societies. So we should really help them strive.

Okay, we can do that.
But I think we have to see that we have learned two things: first, that the Council can be extremely fast if it wants something; and second, that we in Parliament can be extremely weak even if we have negotiating power.
Why? What I mean is: what if the Council also acted quickly on the electoral law? We have been waiting for one year to even hear from you on this regard. The transnational lists should be decided there and I am happy that we will have a chance to do that.
But this also applies to treaty change. From my perspective, this Parliament already triggered Article 48 more than a year ago as a follow-up to the Conference on the Future of Europe.
And what about us? We can say that a consent procedure is not a strong procedure, but the MFF is also a consent procedure, on the seven-year budget, and there we have a full negotiation team actually fighting.
The approval of the Commission President is also a consent procedure. So let’s learn how to be stronger and how to really defend our citizens’ interests rather than to bend to national party leaders.

I just want to say it very clearly – transparency does not conflict with the freedom of the mandate. We have nothing to hide and we have a lot of trust to win back. So it’s good that we show what kind of side income we earn, what kind of meetings we have, because we have nothing to hide, and how we spend our money, because we have nothing to hide. Transparency is not in conflict with the freedom of the mandate.

But to be honest, the more I used it, the more I understood its potential.
It helped me actually write a code to, you know, write my own chatbot in Python, commit it to GitHub and then like upload it to Heroku to somehow make it work. I couldn’t do this without the help of, basically, ChatGPT writing that code for me. So what do we learn from this?
I think we need a couple of principles out there to help us really work with it. The first one is that we should make sure that large models are safe to use and not biased. We should educate our kids, but also our politicians to be able to understand what this technology is. We need authenticity labels to understand what kind of content is AI created. We need to make sure that those who own the data benefit from it or have the right to safeguard it.
We need to tax locally to stop concentration of wealth. We need to make sure that public data is used for public good. We need to make sure that we have a start—up friendly ecosystem to be able to have good AI models here, and we need smart enforcement in global coordination.

I think we hear a lot of talk about asylum, about smuggling and so on, but we should really picture what that means. I mean, here there are around 700 people if the room is full, and what that would mean if almost 600 of them would die. I think it’s important to picture, for a couple of moments, people actually drowning in the bottom of a boat. 
Then we talk about search and rescue, and I ask myself why do we actually call it ‘search and rescue’? Eric, you described it quite well. They were first ignored in this boat and then they were not rescued but they were towed away, which is why the boat very likely capsized. So we shouldn’t call this ‘search and rescue’. We should call this something like ‘ignore and risk their lives’. 
Costas, you said that’s a crime. Yes, it’s a crime – and the crime is not that we’re not following up with smugglers, the crime is that we’re not doing enough to save these lives, that we are stopping NGOs from going there. And yes, that is an Italian problem as well as it is a Greek problem. 
I really believe we need the EU—led search and rescue mission, we need to monitor what happens and we shouldn’t forget the lives of these people that are lost.

And on the left side, I often feel that, you know, the rich are the evil people.
I have to say that, from my perspective, tax is always an infringement of rights. And if I then look at who are we infringing upon – because we do want to have the public goods that we are having and we have to finance them – I would actually also say that we definitely need to radically decrease income tax, labour tax. It’s too high. At the moment, it’s really hard to afford to buy your own flat, to afford to even come through the month in a good way.
And I believe we have to look at the tax revenue. And if we look at it, I mean even The Economist – which is not seen as a very leftist paper – said that the tax that actually has the least negative incentive is the so-called death tax, inheritance tax. So let’s try to really ensure that we don’t have generational wealth so much, but that everybody has a new and good chance by decreasing income tax and increasing inheritance tax.

Six months ago, in a small household in Portugal or in Bulgaria, every child on their phone, on Instagram and so on heard about the European Parliament. That’s really cool. We bridged the communication gap really to everyone!
Sadly, what they heard is that we have bags of cash in our pockets, and we have not been able to win back that trust that we lost back then. We have not been able. This report is going in the right direction, but it’s not going to do that either. So, the key question for us has to be: what can we do to win back trust? Especially since in one year we have elections again and, if we don’t win back that trust, people don’t go to vote or they vote for the radical people who say, ‘Oh, they’re all evil anyway. They’re all corrupt.’
For me, the key question is: what can we do? We can show who we meet publicly, because we don’t have anything to hide. We can show how we spend our public funds that are given to us, because we don’t have anything to hide. Let’s be transparent about the way how we work, and then we can maybe win back some of the trust.

But we have to be honest to our citizens: the real solutions don’t lie there. We already fund third countries like Libya – actually militias over there – to build camps, to host people there. And we see murder, we see rape and we do not see a humane solution. So if we want to really defend the European way of life, our European values, we have to find solutions that are actually in accordance with that. So let’s find a European asylum system with a European asylum application. And then I’m sure the far right will deflate like a popped balloon.

That is a huge, let’s say, satisfaction for me as a federalist and as a speaker of the pan-European party. 
The instrument has been a huge success if we look at the fact that we were able to invest ourselves out of the corona pandemic and that we as the EU have shown that we can be a stable borrower. So I think we have to say this first, but obviously more needs to be done. We need a European finance minister in order to actually organise the own resources taxes that would make us independent at a federal level. 
Obviously, we also need to make the RRF, the Corona recovery fund, a permanent tool that would allow us to implement reforms and push for investments whenever it’s needed.

But what I have to say, what surprises me is that they didn’t open actually all the laws, because my law is not part of the asylum pact. This law is part of the talent and skills package. It’s about attracting international talent to Europe. So I do not understand why you challenge this, because this is actually about the fact that we are losing workforce: 50 million people over the next 30 years.
Our start-ups, our hotels, our companies need talent. We need to find ways to be more attractive. This bill actually allows permanent residents to be able to work all across the European Union.
When you come as a migrant to the EU you don’t face one labour market, you face 27 markets. And even under Trump, the US was more attractive to international talent than the EU. Why? Because if you get fired in New York, you can find a job in San Francisco. When you want to find a new job, when you work in Sofia or Berlin, you have to go through the whole procedure of getting a visa again.
So let’s vote in favour of this bill. I thank my shadows and I thank you for the strong support for this bill.

I have a very quick question regarding the fact that, obviously, the closer you get to death, the more you decide about the future, which is just a fact due to the demographics that we are currently facing.
So I was wondering, in regards to more hard power for youth, would you support a voting age of 16, as we’ve also asked for in the electoral law act from the European Parliament? And what do you generally think in terms of allowing younger people to participate, not only in elections but also when it comes to standing as candidates for these elections?

I think what’s clear is that we currently let people die in the Mediterranean. We let them die by ordering container ships and fisher boats to stand by and wait, we let them die by criminalising and jailing those who want to pull them out of the water, we let them die by systematically funding Libyan coast guards that bring them back to their man-made hells, where they face exploitation, rape and murder.
Colleagues, it has been said, but we have to say it again: we need state-funded, state-led search and rescue missions. We need a truly European system of solidarity, where we also allow for disembarkation across Europe. And we need to stop scandalising migration because this actually just drives the points for the far right as we can see now. The real solution is to find a European common asylum system, because otherwise we will delegitimise the European Union as a whole and we need to stand up to our values.

It’s the internet of things, after all. But who can have access to the non-personal data that these devices produce and who is allowed to share it with others? That is what the Data Act is about: deciding who should have access to what kind of data coming out of connected devices.
That’s why I think this law is actually right up there with GDPR and the Digital Services Act when it comes to the importance for the European digital economy. I think overall we have risen to the occasion, and here I want to explicitly thank Pilar and all the other colleagues for the very good cooperation that actually helped us improve the Commission’s proposal.
Let me give you two examples of where I think we definitely improved the proposal. First, we put the user, the owner of the connected device, back into the centre. They can decide who they want to engage in contracts with and who they want to share the data with.
Second, we created incentives for both the user and the data holder to share data on data markets. And that’s really the core. We need liquid data markets so that new cool startups can come use this data, connect it and build new ideas and applications.
However, there’s one point where I don’t think we got the balance correct, and that is what kind of data can be shared. Here, we gave a million excuses to the data holder to not share data. Trade secret protection, security settings, non-compete provisions, complex algorithms; we made the list so long that the Data Act is in the risk of becoming a data suppression act, allowing data holders to basically not share data. That’s short-sighted protectionist policy. We need to make sure that in the next step, when we negotiate with the Council, we have the maximum amount of data to be shared with the user who is actually producing the data with its use. So let’s fight for that.

It brought us the Recovery Fund, led to coordinated vaccine production and ultimately made sure that no EU country fell significantly behind. I’m therefore a big fan of the Recovery Fund, I’m a fan especially also because it basically conditioned all spending on green and digital investment and made sure that not a single euro would go into projects that harm the environment.
But now I have to admit that the recent reaction I don’t find that impressive. To diversify from Russian gas, we are now subsidising private companies with public money to build LNG terminals and gas pipelines. We fought hard to limit these potential spendings in oil and gas, and I ask the Member States to make sure that they do not spend any dollar in these industries. 
I think also, if I look now at the newest ideas of State aid, there’s again the idea of potentially allowing gas and oil companies to benefit, and I would just repeat once again that innovation and competitive power come from good institutions and good competition and not by weakening State aid and furthering gas and oil.

Europe is the ideal of diversity, the rule of law, social justice and, above all, peace and democracy. A democracy that, for example, just in the previous debate, we can see where we are fighting for our political ideals rather than just for national interests, at least in principle. 
But our democracy has left some space for improvement. Over the last 40 years, we didn’t really update the foundations of how we vote, and over the last 15 years, we didn’t update the functioning of the European Union as such. Why? Because our national leaders don’t seem to care too much. 
If you look at it last year, we triggered the treaty changes and there was no real effect yet until now. No national leader really reacted. We triggered electoral law reforms and, again, nothing. When we look at the right of initiative, there’s also no improvement from the Council side and the same for the right of inquiry. 
But we should really safeguard our democracy and so I’m happy that at least on this side, when we now look at the rights of mobile citizens, of those citizens that move from one Member State to the next, we do see some improvement. And I do want to thank the shadows for the good cooperation in trying to strengthen their rights. 
What have we achieved in this report? We propose to the Council to allow for immediate registration so that whenever you come to a new country, you don’t leave your rights as a citizen of the European Union at the borders, but you can actually take them with you and exercise them easily. 
We want to make it more accessible to vote. So that means that we want to make information available in all languages. We want to make it easier for vulnerable and marginalised groups to vote. We want to make it easier for even people with disabilities, older persons, homeless people to cast their vote. 
It’s also important that we take note of what works well in different Member States. And so we also recommend to update electoral laws when it comes to postal voting, advance physical voting, proxy voting, mobile polling stations, and also electronic and online voting to make use of modern technologies. 
We do believe that it should be possible for everyone without derogation to stand as a candidate, as an EU citizen in the different Member States. And it’s now, I think, imperative that we stand together and try to put pressure on the national leaders to actually implement these rights. Because if you look at it, from the 11 million EU citizens who live in different countries right now, only a very marginal part actually stands as candidates. There’s a low voters turnout as well but it’s really striking that in the 2019 elections only over 1 % of the candidates were actually coming from a different Member State. 
We can do so much more. We can be a real transnational, pan-European democracy. But for that, dear colleagues, we really need to make sure that our strong results that we got in our negotiations are also implemented by the Council and that we do get a treaty change and that we do get an update of our electoral law in general.

Just one quick word upfront to our colleagues from the far right. I think you’ve still not really understood history because nations were created to overcome smaller units called kingdoms and dukedoms, and back then being a nationalist was being for progress. And I think you really misunderstood the concept of progress. 
When I started thinking about the theory of democracy, basically when I started building the movement, I heard very often that people don’t really care about the theory of democracy or voting. And I do think that’s absolutely wrong. I think people care very much if they exercise their freedom to move across borders and then are deprived of the democratic rights. I think people care a lot if they’re trying to vote or stand as a candidate and they can’t do that because the voting booth is not accessible. I think people care very much if their vote is unjustly stolen because of unjustified thresholds. I think they care very much if candidates don’t have the chances to present themselves. 
So, colleagues, democracy is fragile and I think we should really use every opportunity to create trust in democracy, to improve our democracies, and ensure that we strengthen it with all our power. And so I’m very happy that we take this step here now, also as a step towards better democracy, against autocracy and for our common European values.

Since then, multiple of our colleagues, people who we work with, people who make laws or who have made laws for all Europeans have been jailed. Every household across the European Union knows about this. But there is a second scandal. And the second scandal is that we haven't done anything since then. Nothing has happened. What have we done? We have written resolutions. We have a new task forces. We have working groups for transparency, working groups for the rules of procedure. But we haven't tangibly changed a thing. This is, for me, a second scandal. 
We need to act now and we need to get back the trust now. We need to win back trust now by implementing the changes we all know. Further protection for whistle-blowers. cooling-off periods for MEPs, stringent transparency on conflict of interests and financial declarations, biting sanctions. But also transparency on every meeting that every one of us has, no matter the capacity, with lobby groups and interest groups. This is simple. Let's win back trust now, let's win back trust for the European Parliament.

We cannot stand idle and let it be, but must regulate it, lest it harm thee. Regulation we need of this device, to guide its course and set the right prize. It must not bring bias to the fore, nor infringe upon our rights, that’s more. Transparency must be its guiding light, and accountability with all its might. And not just some, but all shall gain. Equality and fairness shall not be in vain. So let us act with heart so true and regulate AI as we ought to do. It is not a hindrance, but a path made clear, to make progress sustainable and bring good cheer.’

I was myself in Kyiv this summer and I fell in love with the city and with the people who are trying to live a regular life despite the constant attacks from the air. 
But behind their remarkable resilience, there’s a huge and immense tragedy, with attacks on households, families and children at any given point in time. So we must do three things. The first one is we need to look at our sanctions and see if they are economically biting Putin at this very moment and instantly. Second, we need to invest not only with public sector but also with private sector money in the areas of Ukraine that are currently safe with the help of war insurances. And thirdly, we need to make sure that our weapons deliveries are actually working from all our countries, including Germany, with the tanks that are needed. 
I think we have a chance now with a sanctions package to also sanction political parties and all their party members to make sure Russians have a choice: leave the parties that are pro-war or face sanctions.

I am obviously joking, but I have to tell it to all of us. We have to be honest. If you listen to the Beatles, the Foo Fighters or Limp Bizkit, you’re not young anymore. If the people that go clubbing over the weekend are half your age, you’re not young anymore. So the reality and the funny thing about an ageing societies is that if you’re older, you outvote the young or, to say it a bit differently, the closer you are to death, the more you decide about the future. This obviously leads to absurd situations where you have a German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, campaigning as a full campaign promise to never touch pension schemes. That’s a great strategy if you want to get the old ones.
A year of youth won’t change these structural issues. And so we have to ask ourselves, what can we actually do? I think what would really help is to actually give voting rights to 16-year-olds and also to ensure that every 18-year-old across this continent has the right to stand as a candidate for elections. We should prioritise the issues that will have a longer-term effect, which means we should not concentrate too much on the short term. The longer-terms are the ones that will actually affect the people who are young now or that are still to be born. That does definitely include the climate.
And then I think as parties, as politicians, we need to make a step, an extra effort, to talk to young people more and to basically show them that it’s more fun to be here to fight against oil and gas than to throw processed food at paintings.

And since then, year by year we have been discussing and not much has happened. We have failed more or less to come up with such a system. And every day the right—wingers in this House are very, very happy about this because they can instrumentalise this to grow.
And we have seen this. How did Lega get big? How did the AfD get big? How did Marine Le Pen get big? It’s all by capitalising on the fears of migration. This, for me, was one of the reasons of founding a European movement, because I feel that we have not found a system to actually take decisions to solve this issue. And what happens instead is that we have a system of basically deterrence by suffering. We fund Libyan coastguards, we fund billions for border controls, we criminalise NGOs, but we have not found a solution yet.
So I would urge you once again, please set up a European search—and—rescue mission. Please ensure that we have mechanisms to embark asylum seekers and please make sure that maritime law is upheld and NGOs are safeguarded.

Uncontrolled individual men who somehow lost it because of their ego, their delusional narratives, their hunger for power, their narcissistic need to feel important. They are the real problem. We have seen it with Donald Trump in the US. We have seen it in China quite recently. We have seen it in Qatar with the Ayatollahs in Iran and with Putin in Ukraine. Uncontrolled men can be deadly.
And sadly, Viktor Orbán, in his own way, is heading in a similar direction. He is unchecked by the media. He is unchecked by the justice system, which he controls. He is unchecked by his party, who would never vote him out of power. He is unchecked by the opposition, who he threatens. And he’s unchecked by the Hungarian people who he lies to, blatantly.
However, Orbán does know that you, Commissioner, could actually rein him in by cutting the funds that oil his corrupt machine. And that’s why he’s blackmailing today. But this time he has gone too far. His blackmail is too outrageous and too dangerous. Today he’s vetoing the NATO membership of two EU countries, effectively putting the citizens at risk. He’s vetoing sanctions against Russian oligarchs. He’s vetoing the 18 billion for Ukraine that they need so urgently. And he’s vetoing the global minimum tax on Apple and co., depriving us of better schools and of higher pensions.
So, Commissioner, as we can see with Trump, the only language that these people understand is the language of hard power. Therefore, I ask you again, stand firm. Once Orbán reinstates the justice system, allows for fair elections, stops stealing EU cash, invites the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and stops this blackmail, we can talk about unblocking funds. Until then, stand firm.

And today, colleagues, and tomorrow is a point where we can actually make this happen.
Right here with REPowerEU we can ensure that we act on climate. How? We can make sure that there’s not additional money pumped into oil infrastructure. And we can do much better than throwing processed food at Rembrandts and Monets, because here we can actually vote on stopping billions of EU money flowing into the hands of the oil lobby and the oil industry. So this is where it counts and so I ask you, colleagues, please uphold the ban on any money flowing into oil infrastructure, because here today we have the chance to actually make this happen.
It is true that we need to ensure energy security, but don’t let yourselves be fooled: we need to be absolutely clear that the current energy crisis does not require investment in fossil fuel infrastructure that will be operational in five years. This does not help the current energy crisis, and we need to make sure that everyone understands that. Solving the current energy crisis means a fast transition to sustainable and renewable energy, and with our votes tomorrow we can make sure that this happens.
So thanks a lot for the good cooperation to the rapporteurs. Thank you for the positive negotiations that we had, and I look forward to the vote tomorrow.

I think our lack of ambition when we look at this regulation is not sufficient. 
I’ve been trying to build a European party now for five years with 18 member parties in the different Member States. I can tell you that we need to rethink how we can make them visible and how we can ensure that they are transparent, so that we see where all the money comes from, especially if we have a war of disinformation running. This is not sufficient. The recast procedure, to be honest, didn’t allow us to really go into detail to find these ways of making the political parties more visible and being ambitious in our approach. 
We have heard a couple of examples where that could have worked, for example, the European political associations. We have new ideas in other legislation that we could have transferred into this one to allow for real European elections. Again, if I see what was happening with the Commission President yesterday proposing that we have a European Convention, we need to be more bold. We need to actually deliver on a European democracy.

The Recovery Fund negotiations were extremely intense – and I can still feel parts of this mini—trauma when I see the colleagues here, because of all the all—night sessions that we spent – but they have also been extremely successful. For the first time ever, the European Union decided to take up common debt of such as size to invest us out of the Corona pandemic crisis and all the horrible social and economic effects that ensued. With a large majority in this House, we decided that we wouldn’t just build back in any way, but that we would build back better, that we would build back by fuelling the green transition, by fuelling the digital transition, by making sure that we have new standards for green investment when we do that, and that we also apply this new standard for green investment to cohesion funds. 
Since then, actually, a lot of remarkable things have happened. We have seen countries implement reforms that have not been tabled for years. We have seen a lot of countries with very good and innovative ideas of how to actually do this green and digital transition. And we have seen that and we have also fought for the fact that no euro should actually go into any form of spending that would harm the environment. 
That’s the positive side. But we have also obviously seen some issues and I think it’s really important that we point them out so that we can address them and also learn for the future. Some countries still did greenwashing, and I can name Germany with their hybrid cars is one example. Some Member States refuse to adhere to the necessary safeguards for our European taxpayers’ money when it comes to, for example, the rule of law. We have talked about this in the last session, obviously in the case of Poland, but also when it comes to corruption.

So what can we learn from this? I think we need more parliamentary oversight – that’s clear – so that such things can’t happen, like the Polish recovery plan. We need to make sure that we turn the tool into a permanent tool because we can see that new crises are coming up and we need a permanent fiscal architecture to be able to address the challenges that are coming. And we need to make sure that all conditionality, when it comes to the rule of law and green spending, are upheld. 
Thank you very much for that additional time.

Colleagues, I want to take one second to thank those individuals who had the foresight to build this Union that we are currently debating in. I think it’s a huge achievement that we have this chance to debate here together.
But since the founding, a lot has changed and we have discussed it and heard it here. There are a lot of topics that we need to work on here together in the European Union so the ‘what’ has changed. But also we realise the examples of the ‘how’ that need to be improved. We have heard about the veto. I would add, in general, that we should also improve the Council as a whole, maybe abolish it and replace it with a more functioning body. 
But I just want to say one thing. This debate is not about left or right. It is not. It is about giving citizens the chance to choose what kind of direction their Europe should take. It’s about empowering a government that is elected by a parliament to make decisions and to be able to act. And if the citizens don’t like it, in the next elections they can vote this government out. So let us not make it about left or right. Let’s make it about daring more democracy.

Talent is a key success factor for European competitiveness, but we punch way below our weight. Why is that? 
Because we have 27 completely separate labour markets still. It’s not as attractive as if we had one big labour market because we have these harmful and hurtful narratives that we just heard again here in this House, and the very closed idea of what an identity can actually look like in Europe. And we have an insufficient equalisation of rights which needs to be strengthened. 
So I want to thank the Commission to bring forward this new package. I think there are very good elements in there when you look at the long-term residence directive. We need to increase European mobility. We need to make it easier to get access to a long-term residence permit. And I want to especially thank you for the talent pool, because this is an idea that I brought to the Commission two years ago, so I’m very happy that it has now been taken up. 
I think it’s really cool that international talent now has the chance to express their interest to work in Europe and then be matched with European employers. We have to work on that, make it interoperable with what the private sector is already proposing so that we can really attract talent to Europe and make Europe more attractive. So let’s get to work.

I just want to make this very haptical. This whole House is built on the trust of citizens in their elected officials. We need to live up to this trust. That means that we can do two things that all parliamentarians should be able to do: one is that we are actually able to propose laws and also amend laws that already exist; the second is that we can vote for the European Commission. 
Then we can transfer the trust that citizens gave us into the actual representative democracy that we should be. I think tomorrow we have a good chance to start this process of Treaty change to bring all of these ideas of a better parliamentary democracy into the European Union. I’m very happy that we are going this way.

Madam President, I said this to Prime Minister Morawiecki when he was here, and it has to be absolutely clear. Our Union is based on Treaties, and treaties need enforcement by a functioning justice system. If we have political puppet courts in our Member States, the laws that we write here are worth nothing. Now, you caved in to the pressures and blackmailing of the Polish Government, and we have seen absolutely zero improvement on the Polish side when it comes to their justice system, and yet you still recommended the recovery plan for approval. 
The majority of this House, and some of your commissioners, believe this to be a huge mistake. We have little trust that the milestones you negotiated will prevent the Polish Government from sanctioning and dismissing judges, or flooding Polish courts with political appointees; I think this actually falls behind your own criteria. 
Colleagues, to ensure that the rule of law is upheld, we have to do two things. First, we need to ensure that our national governments do not approve the Polish recovery plan until the judgments of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights are implemented. Second, it needs to be clear that we will use all the tools available to us to make sure that the Commission does not approve any European taxpayers’ money, as you have said, flowing to Poland without real reforms taking place. And yes, this also includes the tool to force the Commission to resign. We have to ensure a Union where the Treaties are upheld and a rule of law is in place. 
So, Madam President, please do the right thing.

I think we had long hours trying to figure out what the best use of AI in Europe is. 
But let me go one step back. When we hear AI, I think – and this is thanks to the movie industry – we often think of bots and of holograms of all of us, MEPs, of the Executive Vice—President to be just replaced by AI in this kind of futuristic scenario. But that’s not what AI really is about. In all seriousness, it’s about an objective function. It’s about probabilistic models, and very often our companies are still trying to grapple with what AI is about. So they’re making their way from a very analogue life to an AI—based business model. 
In this struggle, we see that we have some issues. For example, one is that there’s a strong tendency to market dominance, and that is just the case because you still need a lot of data to train your AI algorithms. I think Europe is trying to find its way in this struggle, and we’ve seen that if you give too much market dominance, there can be abuses of that. We need to find ways to counter that. And we have seen that, for example, maybe in the Chinese model, AI is used to control society. We have to also fight against that. 
So what can help us to make these steps correct? I think it’s crucial that we make our algorithmic function focus on human agency, and this has been said before. So we need to safeguard fundamental rights, but we also need to find markets concentration. That can be done if we enable our start—ups, our companies, to enter these markets so there’s no closed markets, and there’s no market dominance. I think this is a struggle that is worth fighting and that is also very much represented in the report. 
Let us continue the struggle, in the Data Act and all other files that are still being discussed in the AI world, so that we create a European way of looking at AI and make it possible for our companies to thrive.

Democracy is a provocation for some people. And we can also see this, sadly, in this Chamber. So what do we have to do? We have to dare more democracy. That’s exactly what they fear. Let us dare more democracy. I said this also on Saturday at the conclusion and I say it now after we voted positively on the transnational list, we need to dare more democracy. 
If you look at the conclusions that all these citizens that actually dared more democracy came up with, you see that there’s a lot of very positive stuff in there: abolishing the veto, making the Council more transparent, calling it a Senate to make it a real second chamber, and giving more rights and powers to Parliament, including the right of initiative, budgetary powers and so on. 
So we need to seriously follow up on this. I am very happy that from the Constitution Committee we already requested to trigger Article 48, to trigger Treaty change, and I hope that the countries will follow up, but I also hope that we can follow up on all the other ideas that don’t need Treaty change.

And I think what we have learned and seen over the last 20 years is that basically, the backroom deals between chancellors, prime ministers and presidents do not work anymore. And why is that? Because they are too non—transparent, and they’re inefficient.
And so what we need to do now in this mandate as well is to give a voice to European citizens. And this is exactly what the second vote does. It gives a second voice to citizens, allowing them to actually express what kind of Europe they want. Is it a more restrictive Europe, a conservative Europe, where migration is a bit curbed, where you have more money for small and medium-sized businesses, and money for Europol? Or is it a more social Europe, where you have minimum wages and I don’t know what? Or is it more liberal, or is it more bold, whatever kind of Europe they want. So you dare more democracy, you don’t take a single thing away from citizens – you give them a vote.
So don’t listen to those people who tell you it’s otherwise. Don’t listen to those who say, ‘28 people, they are so far away from the citizens’. That’s not what this is about. It’s about bringing European parties closer to citizens; that they can, actually, for the first time in their lives, vote for them, say: I like this European programme, I like this European candidate, I like this European party, I want this. Currently, they can’t. And so this is what this is about.
Don’t listen to the people who say, ‘oh, the small and medium—sized Member States, they won’t have a voice’. This is not true. In the first place, if you look at Europe, small and medium Member States field the biggest and most prominent figures already. But it’s not only that. In the file, as Verhofstadt also said, there are enough conditions in there to ensure that this is not the case. So don’t listen to them.
This is really about all of us thinking, as a Parliament, how can we ensure that we can make the step towards a European parliamentary democracy, how we can dare more democracy? And that’s why I would really ask you to vote in favour. 
There are other positive elements, we have heard about them. There’s voting age 16, and this is an indication which is positive. There’s a better gender representation with quotas and zipped lists, and there’s a lot more positive in there that is in regard to minimum standards. 
But there’s also one really negative element in there and I have to mention this. We introduce a threshold of 3.5% for Germany, which, from my perspective, is really sad and bad. I have not heard a single sound argument why this is needed. There’s not a single sound argument out there, and it does take away five million votes from European citizens. That is as much as the smallest five Member States together.
I would still ask you to vote in favour, even though it reduces my likelihood of getting re—elected, because I think it’s so important that we give citizens a voice, and that we dare more democracy with the second vote.

The second point, on bringing European citizens closer; you change nothing by just giving them a second vote. How can that bring citizens further away from the European Union the first time they can actually vote for a European party that you’re part of? And third, on the Spitzenkandidat, there is no system on this earth where the Spitzenkandidat is actually registered in the law. So this is in Germany – I don’t think in any other system – this is by practice, so why do you think that this is worse than, for example, the German system?

It was very nice working with you and very fact-based. That was exemplary. 
I think today’s vote shows that we have actually advanced quite far in our digital policy. You will hear that my voice is still a bit deep because I have jetlag from coming back from the US and talking about data policy to the different stakeholders over there. I realised how close we are to the sweet spot of personal data protection and still enabling innovation at the same time. This is built on the fact that we had a European success with saying that there is a philosophical right of your own data being your own, in a sense, of having that right.
Now, we need to transfer that to the industrial data space. We also need to get to a situation where the usage rights for industrial data are equally clear. The Data Governance Act is really helpful because it basically makes it possible to have neutral platforms and data intermediaries if you want data stock exchanges that you can trust and actually share and trade your data. And then, when we get to the data act, I think we have the obligation to ensure that basically we are now applying what we learned from GDPR to the industrial data space in clarifying who is able to trade co-generated data sets.
The whole idea behind this is that we can really unlock the innovation potential that we have in our start—ups and that we have in our industries with a lot of very innovative and new concepts and new business models that, as the Commissioner said, will create a lot of jobs.

I will try to outline it to you. Basically, since March 2020, no-one has been returned from Greece to Turkey, and that is Turkey’s fault. But just a year later, the Greek Government still imposed a law, which is the inadmissibility procedure or joint ministerial decree, which basically says that everyone who comes through Turkey, and who comes from Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan or Bangladesh, has to be returned to Turkey. But as I just explained, no one is being returned to Turkey. So this was, from the beginning, absolutely trying to stop the right to seek asylum. 
And so we have a Kafkaesque situation, where people are being told to go to police stations to be returned, to then ask Turkey whether they would take them, and Turkey doesn’t even answer this. Then the people are being told: okay, you have to wait for a year. They don’t have access to food; they don’t have access to accommodation. We really have to stop this. I ask the Commission to do something about this to guarantee the right of asylum in Europe.

That’s why I wanted to thank you very much, Commissioner, for your swift action and for bringing all the countries together to grant legal protection so fast. And that’s why I want to thank everyone who’s opening their doors currently in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, but also all across the continent. 
But much more needs to be done and we have to adapt to the situation and every moment. So, I would ask you, Commissioner, to also ensure that everyone who’s fleeing is protected, no matter their skin colour or nationality – also the Russians and Belarussians fleeing their crazy tyrants. 
Even if we decide that some can’t stay, please make sure that they’re all covered by health protection so that they can go to the hospitals to tend to their mental and physical wounds after fleeing. And please ensure that we have a new approach to the European asylum system, so that we can learn from this humane reaction to the fleeing refugees, in our new asylum system.

It’s a very timely report indeed. The recent intensified crackdown on civil society in Belarus and Russia shows one important truth: an organised civil society is a horror for any form of autocratic leadership because it shows if and how they fail their societies. But we don’t need to look that far. Sadly, we see civil society organisations also being targeted and limited in our own Member States. Some leaders don’t want to allow societies to correct their mistakes. 
I’ve witnessed systematic persecution and criminalisation in the field of migration, an area where all our governments are currently failing. And the recent events in Ukraine show another and more humane face for Europe in that matter. So let us build on this humane Europe and show that every human being is worth saving, no matter how far they’ve travelled and no matter what their skin colour. 
Let us build a humane Europe, Commissioner, by supporting civil society organisations, ensuring sufficient funding for CSOs and developing a green strategy for safeguarding civic spaces in the EU.

I think there was a lot of work done, both at Member State level and by the Commission, but also obviously within this Parliament, trying to hold you all accountable in this work. If we think about the adoption of the RRF Regulation, the preparation and also approval of some of the plans, at least the payment requests, the scrutiny that has been done, a lot of work was done. So congratulations on that. 
But, obviously, now we are entering the next year and so the question is what kind of ambition and what kind of control is necessary for the next phase of the RRF? And here I want to ask us to really try to stay on top of this ambition because we still need to stay strong when it comes to Hungary and Poland and some of the other elements in the plans – we need to ensure that they are corrected. We need to ensure that the operational arrangements are of high quality and fair to all Member States and ensure especially that we have agreed on spending and where it is supposed to go. 
I would also say that some of the Member States, like Germany, can be ambitious in re-routing some of the money. I mean, there are still EUR four billion, under the new German government, going to hybrid cars, so I think if we have a change of government, this can also be reflected. And this is true for Bulgaria as well. 
And then we come to control, and here I think we have a couple of elements, which really mean that we need to step-up our game. The first one is we promised to green bond holders that the money will really be spent on green spending. So we need to keep this promise by actually sample-sizing, by testing, by scrutinising in detail the projects that are supposed to be green. And we need to keep the promise to EU citizens that we will use this money to really build solidarity and a strong Union when it comes to economic governance. 
So I wish us all a restful and great break to be able to do that well.

For the third year in a row, I have left these negotiations with a curious realisation. Some EU capitals fundamentally reduce these negotiations to how much they have to pay and seem very often to disregard what they actually get for it, their return on investment.
In light of this, it may be worth going back to why we actually have a European Union budget. We have it because, some time ago, Presidents and Prime Ministers made a confession, collectively, rationally and out of political self-interest. They made the confession that, in the past, conflicting national interests have led us to radicalisation and, ultimately, war. They made the confession that every nation, however grand and historically powerful, is too small to tackle the issues of our time alone. I would say they made the confession that all our individual nations lost part of their sovereignty exactly because, alone, they cannot safeguard or represent their citizens’ rights when it comes to climate change, healthcare, rising energy prices, leadership and research, global trade, national security and so many other fields which we see represented in our budget. This is why we have a common European budget, and this is why we have a common European institution that helps us thrive and regain some of the sovereignty that our individual nation states have lost.
But let’s get back to the content of next year’s budget. From Parliament’s side, the final outcome, as Karlo Ressler has said, is a success. We have barely ever seen such a focused budget underlining our priorities, be it in the fight against climate change, in our solidarity via vaccination campaigns and in supporting our research excellence, just to name a couple of examples. So big congratulations to Karlo and all his colleagues and shadow rapporteurs for the great work. 
On my side of the table, when it comes to strengthening the institutions of the European Union, I believe we have also achieved quite a lot. First of all, this is true for the European Court of Justice. Justice is always on the side of the weak and the persecuted. Strengthening the Court with additional staff and funds therefore means safeguarding the weakest in our societies against those abusing positions of power, and that is always worth it. Second, we were able to reinforce the Court of Auditors to scrutinise the correct spending of the billions flowing by the European Recovery Instrument. A common responsibility requires hard checks and balances, and the Court is crucial in this regard. Third, I’m also very happy that we were able to reinforce the capacities of Parliament, of this House. After years of increased workload, we have finally managed to strengthen our core legislative capacities, which will improve the quality of legislation for all European citizens. 
Let me close by thanking the Council Presidency for their fair negotiations and the Commissioner for very creative solutions, Karlo for the great collaboration, Johan for the calm advice, and my shadows for the continuous support throughout the negotiations, but also to my team – Caroline, Zita and Johannes – for their hard work over the last year.

It feels like no one cares about the people, the individual stories on the ground anymore. Compassion, colleagues, is not something that we should lose once we become politicians. 
Let us make sure, first and foremost, that we care for the lives of those in need, and then we can care, secondly, about everything else. But first, we need to care about the lives of the people in need. Once people are safe, we should stop being naive. The weakness that Lukashenko is trying to exploit is not compassion. The weakness he is trying to exploit is that we do not have a European asylum system. None of this would happen if we had a good and decent procedure for people to go through, across Europe, while we find ways to stop Lukashenko from engaging in human trafficking. 
High Representative, I have two questions. First, will you ensure that there is access for the UNHCR to the European side of the border with Belarus? Second, do you believe that the right to seek asylum in Europe is still intact for the people at the border?

But Fortress Europe is still a reality. We build wires and walls and a few of our guards hunt and beat people up, take away their phones and throw them back over the borders. 
Over the last year, 300 illegal explosions have been recorded in Greece. Two weeks ago, we learned how Croatia is using shadow armies to push people back. And just today, as Sophia has also said, lawyers are suing Frontex – an EU agency – for its role in human rights violations. 
Commissioner Johansson do not waiver in your defence of asylum law. Help Europe to live up to its values of compassion, law and human rights and let us turn Fortress Europe again into a shelter. For that, let’s set up independent mechanisms to monitor our border guards, make EU funds for migration conditional on safeguarding human rights and trigger infringement procedures against all countries that don’t follow European laws.
And please, by all means, never, never, ever legalise pushbacks.

Did you come here to shift the narrative with the help of the claps from the far-right? Is this really what you’re trying to do?
First, your puppet chord attacks the basis of this House, the Treaties. Second, you write a letter saying that the EU is turning into an autocracy. And third, you come and talk here about legal order, while you’ve been trying to curtail the freedom of your judges for years. I really don’t understand why you came here today, and I think soon you will see that your advisers are wrong and that you have gone far too far with what you have been doing.
The Polish people do not want to leave the European Union. We cannot, Commission President, have money flow to a government that does not respect the treaties and therefore we cannot control where it is going. So I ask you to under no circumstance accept the Polish recovery plan and make sure that this tribunal and the judgment are repealed.

They are extremely important and a source of – and the first line of defence for – the prosperity and progress of our continent. Good institutions allow us all to negotiate our different ideas, our different interests and preferences, and decide a common political direction. They provide judgments, solve conflicts, discover fraud and fight villains who selfishly seek to profit off the community. 
Whereas bad institutions, on the other hand, allow a small number of foul apples to put their own power and money above the progress of the many. Bad institutions turn a blind eye to fraud and corruption and bad institutions open the door to state capture, inaction and inequality of citizens in front of the law. Bad institutions allow politicians like Prime Minister Morawiecki to act against the interest of his own people. 
So what is a good institution then? It’s, quite simply, one that is up to the task, that has the legal means, the people and the political backing to do its job, one that is independent and that can’t be corrupted. Do I think that our current institutions are up to the task? To be honest – and this is quite sad – I don’t think they fully are. We ourselves are completely to blame for this. Despite massive changes in the world and great new challenges for the EU, national governments have not reformed the EU since the treaty change in 2007, and the Council continues to block better decision-making. 
The EU institutions are not given the means to do their jobs well. We have had the stable staffing policy and cuts of staff for the last years, and somehow this golden calf of austerity really is hurting our institutions and endangering the progress and prosperity that I have been talking about. So we can’t really continue as we currently are. There are many reasons why this has become more of a problem today. 
First, let’s look at the recovery plan. We have an unprecedented amount of money that is flowing through the different budgets to the Member States. Hundreds of people are needed to really look in the various institutions, to supervise the planning, to monitor the spending of money and to organise the flow of it. Corona has also seen a vast increase in capacities to try to basically grapple with the situation, we have Brexit and other difficult procedures at our borders, and we obviously need to fight climate change, where more resources are needed. 
So Mr Ressler and I have been tasked to defend the Commission’s budget, but also the other institutions’ budgets, against indiscriminate and horizontal cuts. I wanted to use the opportunity here to thank the fellow shadows for the great cooperation that we had in coming up with Parliament’s position on these matters. 
Despite all these challenges that I have been outlining, the Council did not come up with a better and more, let’s say, detailed view on where we stand, but really tried to just go for stable staffing, austerity and always the same old narrative.
But today, Madam Minister, when we also formally start our discussions about the budget, I would ask you to potentially take into account all these factors that I’ve been mentioning and not just see these numbers, but also the tasks that stand behind them because they are quite important and we need to save our institutions.
To say it with slightly more fun words: to stop villains getting fatter, let’s make our institutions matter, to rebut the Polish letter, let’s make our institutions better.

I think we can see this as a start of our formal negotiation to really try to come to the best outcome for our institutions. 
I just wanted to quickly react to some of the comments that have been made, so I didn’t really fully get the translation of what you were saying, but I’m very thankful for the cooperation we have had so far, and also for you mentioning the potential differences or implications that the Polish situation might have on the budget, because I think that’s actually also relevant if you think about it. How can we transfer money to a country that does not accept the treaties? How can we actually believe that the judges will follow up with due diligence if they’re not bound by our common order? And I think that’s a question that we had discussed this morning, and that the Commission also is currently looking into. 
Mr Kuhs asked what he should tell his grandchildren and I actually quite enjoyed this question because I think the first answer would be to tell them that, you know, a Europe of segregated nations with closed borders to each other is not a Europe that they want to live in. 
The second thing, though, which has more to do with the budget, is the question of how we should invest in the future. My colleagues have mentioned many of the points that we believe are relevant for future investment: climate youth programmes, digitisation, ensuring the future competitiveness. I think to get out of this crisis well, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is a good tool, but the whole budget is very important to actually build back better.
In terms of institutional changes that we can also consider to have in the future better working mode, I think it’s important that when we talk about the budget, we also see the context of the overall architecture of our financial and fiscal framework. And here I’m very happy that we are starting this process of understanding that the RRF was a one time tool, but we have an ongoing understanding or issue with the fact that we have a currency union, but not yet a fiscal union, and that is something that we also need to get to.
To end, let me close with what I started with. I think it’s important that we come to a good conclusion for our institutions, for our European Union, to strengthen them, to strengthen the Ombudsman, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, all these institutions that make up our European Union, and I also very much look forward to then, at some point, coming to a conclusion on this budget.

At the same time, today, we have the Afghanistan resettlement forum, where we more or less expect that national ministers will agree not to resettle a single soul in Europe. What a day this is already.
Why is all this happening? There’s a very simple truth. In the absence of an actual European asylum system, a system that could easily cope with the numbers that we are currently seeing and propose the stability of their asylum claims, we have reverted to a system of violence and terror. Violence and terror as deterrence so that people don’t come. We try to match their suffering that they experienced at home with the suffering that they will experience here. 
Pushing people back is just the most obvious symbol of the system. Tents at the seaside where, yet again, families freeze with their children this winter is a second, and another 100 people dying in the Mediterranean over the last two weeks is a third. In the absence of a system, we use suffering to keep control. What a shame for this continent and our enlightened society, but then, enlightenment hasn’t stopped us from committing the worst atrocities in history.
Now the weird thing is that there is a solution. Building a functioning European asylum system does not mean that everyone who comes can stay. It just means that we adhere to our European values while we are processing the asylum claims. I’m happy that, with the European Asylum Agency, we are an ever—so—little step closer to such a system. While the agency cannot process claims itself yet, it can start organising solidarity between Member States. While some changes would be linked to a Dublin reform, it can already start to set minimum standards and ensure that the rights of asylum seekers are safeguarded in the different European systems. The agency, obviously, with the Fundamental Rights Officer, will have a much stronger role in this as well.
In November, I will go visit Samos again. I am quite afraid to go there because I know that I will look people in the eye and have to say that, over the last two years since I last visited, I didn’t really achieve much. However, I am happy that, at least with the European Asylum Agency, we can go in the direction of trying to build a better system. Let’s see this as a start to actually work with those who want to work constructively on a better European asylum system, so that we can give back decency to the people who are arriving and, by extension, to ourselves.

EU taxpayers’ money should not reward governments that violate the most fundamental principles of the European Union. This is especially true for governments that do not accept the primacy of EU law or have a history of corruption, embezzlement and fraud. I therefore urge you not to approve the current Polish or Hungarian plans until we know that this money actually benefits the citizens and safeguards their rights. Stand firm. 
In addition, Commissioner, let’s prepare well for the future. If you act smartly now, you will be able to stop the flow of recovery money every six months for the next five years. For that to work, I ask you to ensure that the plans have strict six-month targets in improving the rule of law and fighting corruption, and second, to let Parliament help you. Make backroom deals public and give us access to all operational agreements between you and the national governments. Commissioner, we are fighting a good fight. Let’s make sure the tide turns, we improve the rule of law, we fight corruption, and benefit the citizens of this Union. I ask you to stand firm.

Damian BOESELAGER,2021-09-14,EN,Presentation by the Council of its position on the draft general budget - 2022 financial year (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-09-14-INT-2-125-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager,  rapporteur. – Mr President, our European institutions are in a delicate situation. On the one hand, the economic consequences of the COVID crisis necessitate prudence in spending and planning. On the other, the crisis itself and our responses to it force us to do things differently, to invest and to recover. 
Minister, let me tell you that I have sympathy for your prudent approach and I myself and the shadows have applied that prudence in developing our position on the budget. We have spoken extensively to all institutions, we have looked at each budgetary line and we have tried to understand clearly where the needs lie. We made clear that this is not a time for unreasonable budgetary increases. But it seems to me that the Council and Parliament still fundamentally diverge in their approach to the budget. Whereas the Council is applying horizontal cuts, the Parliament’s reading is based on a detailed analysis of the needs of each European institution, which supervise, execute and implement EU law and policy.
It is one of those needs that I want to especially highlight in this context. As you know, the recovery fund leads to an unprecedented flow of EU money to our economies. I have negotiated this law and I am immensely proud of what we have achieved. However, the Council completely ignores that additional money also requires additional supervision. In this context, it seems bizarre to me that the Council cuts posts and budget for the Court of Auditors and, by the way, also for the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). We should be increasing these budgets because European citizens demand that funds are not being wasted or defrauded. I also cannot understand why you would like to cut many other institutions like the Court of Justice or the European External Action Service (EEAS). All of those posts are, in our view, fully justified and based on the reality on the ground. 
Finally, I want to remind you of the incredibly important need to reform and update our European institutions at all times to meet the challenges of our time. We owe it to citizens to constantly rejuvenate and reform from within. That’s why I’m incredibly proud that, with COVID, our Parliament has risen to this task and has started a process of internal rejuvenation and reform, which is actually ongoing as we speak. In open process, we have looked at ways in which to be better at scrutiny, we want to improve the committee culture and the hearings in the way they work and we want to strengthen the plenary debates to be more engaging and representative of our issues. I invite all institutions to undergo a similar process of rejuvenation and internal reform. 
In the same spirit, I invite you, Minister, to push the Council to actually actively engage in the Conference on the Future of Europe, where these debates are taking place on a grander scale. It’s our shared responsibility to ensure that our institutions are ready for the 21st century and that we can actually work for the well-being and interests of our citizens. I can only hope that the Council and Commission join us in the spirit of responsibility, reform and rejuvenation.

For years, European countries tried to work together towards a more resilient Afghanistan and in this endeavour relied heavily on locals to support this. 
Amongst these locals are journalists, activists, human rights defenders, women and young people. They knew they took a risk but they still did it, and they were brave enough to support with us and to work with us for a better future for their country. Now they ask for our help, they ask to be saved, but we hear European leaders fostering this narrative of defence and trying to score political gains by playing into nationalistic fears. This is disgraceful.
With our resolution today we ask all European leaders to be courageous and compassionate. We ask them ambitiously to step up resettlement pledges at the September Resettlement Forum. We are talking about tens of thousands of pledges that we would need. 
Second, we ask for safe and legal pathways to be established. We heard about humanitarian visas and we ask for deportations to Afghanistan to be halted, and lastly, to cooperate with all involved actors to ensure that no lives are lost.

One and a half years during which this IT professional could have gone anywhere in the world. In a global competition for talent, that’s just not good enough.
If you want to attract talent to Europe, you need to be attractive, and that’s why I’m super happy that today we can celebrate the agreement on the new Blue Card with you from the Commission as well, because finally, people can move from one Member State to the next within one month. Finally, people can take with them the years they agglomerated on long-term residence from one country to the next, making it much more attractive to come to Europe in the first place. And finally, IT professionals can apply for the Blue Card even without a university degree, making this Blue Card the ultimate European tech visa.
So today is a day of celebration, and tomorrow we should put our heads together again to ensure that it comes into effect as fast as possible and to tackle, one by one, all pathways for labour migration so that people don’t have to wait one and a half years if they have a job offer in Europe.

It has been three years since we initiated Article 7 against Hungary. Three years of big words and empty threats. Three years over which the deconstruction of the Hungarian democracy has accelerated. Every day Orbán's government violates the rules that our freedom as a European community are built on. Rules to safeguard the free press and show fair elections, to ensure the independence of judges, rules to protect the diversity of our societies. 
The new law is another terrible example of how Orbán violates these rules. But today still is a day of hope, because today the European Commission has the power to change this course; because today Parliament and Council stand behind you asking for a strong response; because today the rule of law mechanism is in place; and finally, because today you have the power to make the payment of seven billion euros, equalling 5% of Hungary’s annual GDP, conditional on the change of course. So I urge you to use these powers, then today can be a day of hope.

If we get it right, it can be a blueprint for future European fiscal architecture, enabling a more resilient, sustainable and fair economy for all European citizens.
My Group supported you in setting it up. However, looking at the plans submitted by the Member States, we are concerned. Some Member States treat the RRF as a simple refinancing tool, which means that the stimulus effect is neutralised and costs are simply shifted to the European level. Many Member States avoid ambitious reforms necessary to modernise the administration, even though the regulation requires them to do so. And most importantly for my Group, many Member States try the old practice of greenwashing, trying to sell hybrid cars, gas boilers and other dirty investments as green.
President von der Leyen, do not give in to these reluctant governments. Do not approve plans that don’t fully comply with the law. Tell President Macron that he should address the French CSR. Tell Chancellor Merkel that she cannot use EU funds to get rid of her hybrid cars. Tell Prime Minister Draghi that he needs to fight greenwashing. And tell all governments across the EU to enforce the ‘do no significant harm’ principle. You have the full backing of this House to ensure that money is not wasted on national pet projects but used to fuel a green and a real tradition with a lasting impact. You said it: ‘Long live Europe’. I would say: ‘Long live a better and reformed Europe’.

Damian BOESELAGER,2021-05-19,EN,New avenues for legal labour migration (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-05-19-INT-3-170-0000_EN.html,"  Damian Boeselager,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, what image comes to our mind when we hear the term ‘migrant’? What happens if you replace that term with ‘international talent’ or even ‘expat community’?
Our debate on migration is distorted. The fears of losing our culture are inflated by right wing populist rhetoric. However, migration lies at the basis of all European culture, as the Vice President said. Today, 95% of all migrants come to Europe regularly, many of them with some form of a work visa, contributing to our society’s diversity, to our economy – and, to be frank, offsetting the effects of an aging society on our pension schemes – and helping us through this crisis, as it has been said before.
I come from the private sector, and I’m in close exchange with many start-ups across the continent. Next to a lack of access to capital, their key success factor is access to international talent. Only sufficient talent will enable them to thrive and create jobs for Europeans as well. But we still fail to attract the best talent and skills. In fact, even under Trump, the US was more attractive to migrants than the European Union.
Why? Because first, we are still seen as a rather racist society. And second, because we don’t have a unified labour migration system, but 27 separate ones. Our national governments still think it makes sense to compete against each other when it comes to migration.
With this report, we have shown that there is a separate way: a new way. Together as one House we ask to Europeanise our system to ensure that we get to a European migration code, and that migrants can profit from the full European labour market, and that we can profit from them.
Second, we ask to foster equal conditions for everyone who works here, no matter where they’re from, when it comes to wages, rights and working conditions. We have to fight labour exploitation.
And third, we ask for new pathways, and I’m very happy that the Vice President has mentioned some of them, like the talent pool, which I’m presenting at some point as a pilot project. But there are others: youth mobility schemes, visas for job and vocational training, the Long-Term Residence Directive and the single permit. It’s clear: Europe is strongest if we work together, especially when it comes to labour migration.

I have learned to negotiate laws via Webex, I engage with citizens over Zoom, and I plead with the Commission via Teams. My team at home is constantly working remotely and my office is as empty as the plenary in Strasbourg. Even though I’m proud to say that this institution has weathered the circumstances really well, I can’t wait to go back to normality.
But what will the new normality look like? What can be learned from these times? And what do we really want to return? We don’t have these answers yet but the discussions over the 2022 budget were very much marked by these questions. And so I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs, but also the Bureau and especially the EP administration for finding good solutions and for really engaging in this debate and scrutinising the budget in the best way we can to find answers and to create space for these answers.
Together we agreed to strengthen the legislative capacity of this House. We agreed to find ways to travel less, to be more efficient and to be greener and more transparent. We agreed to pay more attention to gender—related budgeting and – and that’s very important for me as well – we created space for the Conference on the Future of Europe to work. So, because of all of these reasons and also because it was my first rapporteurship, I would like you to vote in favour and I ask you for that.

It is pan-European, which will benefit all citizens and companies in all Member States. It puts digital skills and support for digitisation of SMEs and start-ups at the core of EU policy, and it ensures parliamentary scrutiny over every euro spent under the programme. I therefore thank the rapporteur and I also thank the shadows and the Commission and the Council for the good work on this file – but it’s clearly only a first step.
Our SMEs and start-ups have now all embarked on their digital journey. There are different levels of sophistication in this process, and we can help them succeed if we do a couple of things. First, we need to ensure that they’re not forced into a technical infrastructure that they can’t escape from. Second, we need to ensure that the dominance of certain actors, for example in the data market, does not translate itself automatically onto the machine-learning and AI markets. And third, we need to ensure that the new standards that are being set for data sharing and such are not decided in a closed circle just between a couple of Member States and between a couple of big companies. In the end, our European digital policy will only be successful if we understand that innovation can come from anywhere, and especially the smallest actors.

Space is not only a place for reaping the benefits of human ingenuity, but also a frontier that reflects the political issues we witness here on Earth. Space plays a huge role in our daily lives already, as we know, enabling satellite TV, internet and smartphone connections, precision in agriculture and disaster relief. Our European space programmes and SMEs play a key role in providing these services but, if we create the space where they can thrive, they can do much more. We can expect innovations and technological breakthroughs that can tackle climate change, and predict environmental diseases. We can promote research in health and fight humanitarian hardships that we currently see.
I think that, in order to be able to reap these benefits, we need to do four things. First – and my colleague Niklass Nienaß has also said this – we need to Europeanise our efforts. That means both when it comes to law, but also when it comes to our Space Programme. Other countries won’t be waiting for us and we need to ensure that we consolidate our governance and invest.
Second, we need to enable private investment. We don’t have to retract – and we shouldn’t retract – our government spending in the area, but we need to enable private investment to increase access. 
Third, we need to ensure fair access to data so that downstream commercialisation is fair and competitive and can really bring out the smartest among us. 
Fourth, and most importantly, space does not belong to any one nation. It is a place for discovery and research for all mankind. We should treat it as such and enforce international rule—based systems to counter space militarisation and debris. If nations use outer space for their individual gain, we face a tragedy of the commons, where we will hinder the progress that we could make together for all of Europe, but also for all of mankind.

This is the key question that we are trying to tackle with this report. At its core this question is a question of power and I think with GDPR we have made a big step towards ensuring that some of this power is being given back to individuals. With this report we ask for further steps to rebalance this power. Currently, there seems to be an imbalance when it comes to the concentration of market power in many of the aspects related to data.
We need to make sure in our future steps in this legislation when it comes to the Data Governance Act, when it comes to the Data Act, that we give power back to individuals, that we safeguard their rights, that we clarify the role of intermediaries and that we empower governments and businesses to share data in a trusted and safe environment. This has to be the European model to get towards greater digital competitiveness.

Since then, businesses have been engaging with national governments to express their ideas when it comes to digital infrastructure or hydrogen, and this can be positive for modernisation. But when it comes to other interests, say, from civil society actors, unions, local and regional governments or even national parliaments, this is completely different.
Almost all governments are refusing to engage in serious consultations. Even though this is a requirement within the text. This is a mistake. Let’s make sure that this recovery fund is best practice, a beacon for a future of common European macro-economic governance where all interests are represented and, frankly, the best ideas win.
Furthermore, I urge countries like Germany and the Netherlands to commit to additional investments and actual reforms, to not waste this chance, even though elections might be looming.

This law is the centrepiece of the EU recovery fund, and it lays the foundation for something new.
When I entered this House one and a half years ago, there was no common European fiscal policy and no needs—based solidarity in times of crisis. When the financial crises hit in the past – and we all know they hit hard – the only support our countries could find lay in unloved and undemocratic tools like the ESM.
With our vote today, this will change. The RRF is no ordinary law. It is a political, federalist, European innovation, a game changer for our common European economic policy and solidarity in Europe. Our vote today may very well mark the beginning of a more permanent architecture to raise EU funds and to direct them where they are most needed, irrespective of nationality.
This law sets new, unheard-of standards when it comes to investment. It requires countries to address the adverse effects of the crisis on women, to invest in the next generation and to support the ones most hit via its social pillar. It ensures that over the next six years, EUR 250 billion  need to be invested to fight climate change based on an improved investment tracking methodology, while not spending one cent on harmful activities when it comes to the environment. It ensures that over the next six years, another EUR 135 billion will be invested towards the digital transition.
But this law is not only about investment, it’s also about reforms. It asks countries to tackle the weaknesses that they have, because we can potentially get out of this crisis with investments, but we will not be able to weather the next one without reforms.
So with today’s vote, the ball is in the court of the countries, and they need to draw up their national recovery and resilience plans. But I would like to give them four short messages on this process.
First, the struggles we can see in some countries show that these plans need to be publicly debated and scrutinised. You need to involve the public, and this cannot just be backroom deals. Second, all countries need to tackle reforms – also Germany, the Netherlands and France. Third, invest fresh money. Don’t just repackage existing stimulus packages. And fourth, we from the European Parliament, we will be watching, because we care.
We will scrutinise every euro spent. We will scrutinise every plan to ensure that this project is a success.

We decided to raise an unprecedented amount of EUR 750 billion to be able to invest in the green and also the digital recovery and to get out of this crisis better than we went in.
Now it’s time to fight equally hard to make sure that this money is put to good use, and for this I demand three things.
First of all, that we ensure that every cent that is spent is transparently spent, that we know where this money is going. Second, that this money is used as additional money, that we make sure that we have new projects in the green and digital spaces, so we don’t just refinance existing pet projects of national governments. And third, that citizens are involved, that stakeholders are involved, and that most importantly our national governments are involved when we draw up these plans to make sure that the money is put to good use.

I would like to thank Pierre Larrouturou and Olivier Chastel for the tough and very good negotiations. I think the outcome is a greener and more digital budget. While I’m happy with the overall agreement, I’m concerned that the Polish and Hungarian governments caused such massive disruption to our negotiations. I’ve been in this Parliament for more or less 18 months and I’ve gone through negotiations of two annual budgets, the MFF programmes and currently the EU’s recovery programme. I still consider myself a newbie but I do want to share three hard lessons learned with you.
First of all, multilateralism does work. We did find an agreement and we did find a good agreement on this budget. Second, our EU decision-making is still deeply flawed. We allow individual governments to outright blackmail this Union, holding the wellbeing of all EU citizens to ransom for their own, at times, personal financial benefit. And third, too often we cave in to this blackmailing and every time we compromise in the direction of these blackmailers. We show European citizens that in this Union sometimes money trumps values. Last week’s European Council conclusions are a perfect example of this phenomenon. I think we should never trade principles over money or values over power, and I would really urge the von der Leyen Commission to set the record straight in this direction.

The report we are about to discuss addresses the EU elections in 2019. These have been somewhat incomplete because some of our Members were not able to take their rightful seat in this House: a House that is protected and independent. Oriol Junqueras is one of these Members. Our amendment deplored that he is not present in this House with us, urging the European Parliament’s President to recognise the judgment of our highest judicial body: the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EP is to follow the Court’s judgment, even if the national judiciary does not. This is a case of primacy of EU law. Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure thus does not apply to make this amendment inadmissible.
I am deeply concerned and worried about how technical rules are used for political purposes, and I would therefore like to make a point of order to re-admit our amendment to the report and to have Parliament vote on it.

I want to remind everyone in this House that this House already decides on laws that affect 450 million Europeans and maybe potentially many more across the world. I hope that at one point this House will also be able to initiate laws and will field a European government, hopefully. This House is already a beacon of European democracy and I think it’s really important that we try to increase legitimacy and that we try to improve the way we are elected into this House, at all times. I think the report shows ways to do this. 
First of all, I think it’s very important that we set minimum standards to ensure that there’s a trusted process. That means minimum standards when it comes to the registration of a party, when it comes to the registration of this party for the European parliamentary elections, when it comes to internal party democracy about how to field candidates, when it comes to party financing and fraud control, and when it comes to the election procedures at the actual election date. 
Second, and this has already been mentioned by some colleagues, we need to Europeanise these elections. It’s not enough that we all work in our national context to try to put forward European topics. We need to have an actual European debate about European topics and I think there are some ways to discuss this further, as has been discussed for transnationalist Spitzenkandidaten. But we should also try to regionalise and localise the elections so that parliamentarians are closer to their citizens as much as possible, so that people have some people to relate to and to reach out to. 
I think we should not shy away from any of these discussions. We should discuss all the options on the table to be able to improve our electoral procedures. When we look across the Atlantic, I think we can see how important it is to have trusted procedures, especially when it comes to the transition of powers. Let us not waste this legislative chance, let us try to improve the electoral law.

We deliberately create suffering and hardship in camps to dissuade people from coming. We try to match their suffering outside Europe by creating suffering on European soil, traumatising people with hardly any shelter, sustenance and medication. I call this the policy of ‘deterrence by systematic suffering’. 
Today, I plead to you for two things. First of all, please help all the people of Moria to travel to communities across Europe who are very happy to welcome them. And second, I plead to you to ensure that something like Moria can never happen again.
I repeat your call, ‘no more Moria’, but I would also extend it. No more Chios, no more Samos, no more camps in general. Don’t finance camps with EU money. Close them all.

We must address the European migration and asylum crisis.
Yes, we must establish security, but what is security? As long as EU countries are closing down their harbours to migrants and refugees, there is no security in the Mediterranean. As long as COVID—19 is being used to create de facto detention camps on the Greek islands, there is no security in the Mediterranean. As long as EU money is being used to fund Libyan coastguards and to circumvent asylum law, there is no security in the Mediterranean. 
Security in the Mediterranean can only be reached by applying asylum and maritime law, by allowing people to disembark after days on freighters and by relocating people out of the camps on the Greek islands. Day by day, we endanger the lives of human beings, of our brothers and sisters, as our Christian Democrat friends would say, but we can change and we can learn from our mistakes.
First, we need to set up a European asylum system that is centred around the right to asylum and around the asylum interview. Second, we must acknowledge that we are a continent of immigration and we must create new channels and new pathways, and create new opportunities for people to enter the European Union.

And the answer is: the situation has got worse. We haven’t done anything at EU level to make the situation better. Yes, we still give money, but in the end, the idea of creating a floating barrier to stop people even asking for asylum and the overcrowding in the camps is still so bad that people are protesting now – both the local population and the refugees.
So I would ask us to stop the blame game between the Council and the Commission and act on both sides, as much as we can, to improve the situation on the ground. That means, on the Commission side, triggering the Civil Protection Mechanism today, and, on the Council side, actually accepting minors and refugees, who need our help so badly on the ground. Let us actually act today and not tomorrow.

I am very happy to hear that you are an entrepreneur and founder yourself. I am as well. I founded a political movement so it was in a bit of a different sphere, but I’m also a huge fan of innovation and competitiveness. I also therefore welcome better regulation, especially decreased uncertainty. We know that especially for smaller businesses and start-ups it’s really hard to keep up if there is legal uncertainty, regulatory uncertainty, so I hope we can get better at that.
But I also see, like my colleague from Renew, quite a boring trend: that we want to weaken competition, or at least, as the governments in Poland and Germany (my own country) and France and Italy have said, and that is exactly the opposite of innovation and competitiveness. So I hope that we can safeguard, with the Commission and Parliament together, the competitiveness of all the small players by not weakening competition.

There are also, at the moment, no more guardians taking charge of their legal cases and they are already traumatised and sick when they arrive. So I’m very happy, Commissioner, that you take first measures and want to improve the situation.
And I would like to point out to the State Secretary that the Member States are blocking any additional, even voluntary, support at this very moment and so I would ask, State Secretary, that you please press for additional steps here. But I also want to bring your attention to a fact that is overlooked, which is that the Member States are even opting out of the current responsibilities that they have under this law that we already have in place. So, my Member State, Germany, is currently declining 70% of the family reunification cases for these children. Which means that we are basically telling them: even though you have family, you are not welcome here, and this is not okay.

I just want to mention a few points that have been mentioned already to showcase that. We do recognise the problems – and because we recognise the problems, we’re trying to find solutions, and the problems as Mr Verhofstadt has said and also Ms O’Brien and others, lie in all the challenges we face with migration, with our social standards, and so on. We cannot address them fully because we are currently blocked in our solutions. That is why we need this conference to go into the future. The second question about the national interest. Yes, currently, we can’t defend our national interests because national interests are European interests and that is I think important to understand. 
The majority of this House is for the future, and the future can only be obtained if we find a common future for Europe together and that means to have a common vision together that is shared with the citizens, and I hope that with this conference we can go down this path.

The second one is that we don’t only go bottom up as Mr Verhofstad said, but that we also play back our results to the citizens and say, ‘do you agree? Do you think these are good results?’ And only via this accountability, I think will we be able to hold all of us and all politicians accountable.

So I think that would help in terms of transparency. 
I was also, let’s say, more in an observer role for this first negotiation. For me it was very interesting because I learned three things. The first is that the new set—up of Parliament with Renew and the Greens also pushing priorities can lead to a budget which is actually better. I’m very happy with the outcome in that direction. 
The second is that a big deal is possible, and I also want to thank the rapporteurs for their great work in having a good negotiation strategy and working in a proactive and deal—finding way, and also for ensuring that we move from the Commission proposal towards Parliament’s position. So it is positive that we got EUR 400 million on top of that.
The third thing is – and this makes me a bit less optimistic – that the national governments often seem only to care about the bottom line of how much they have to pay and how much they get back into their own pockets. If we now think about this as the prelude to the MFF for the seventh annual framework, I think we have to step up our game because the problems that we are facing – and I was in Lesbos a week ago – are so much bigger than what we are currently committing to. We shouldn’t only be thinking about our national budgets, but really about how to fund common solutions to the biggest problems of our time so that we honour the demands of our citizens and that we are actually able to act from a European level.

Let me remind you that this promise was given even before the Paris Agreement. As it stands, we are falling short of this promise by EUR 3.5 billion. I also strongly support the initiative for using the entire financial flexibility towards young Europeans in Erasmus and the Youth Unemployment Initiative. 
But this discussion is also about something bigger. It’s about demonstrating Parliament’s ambition for the next budget. In the European elections EU citizens have shown us that they expect us to be more ambitious to provide European solutions to the challenges that affect their lives. We need a budget that increases, rather than decreases, the EU’s capacity to act when it comes to climate change, migration, asylum and youth unemployment. For that we need a budget that serves European people across all Member States. We should also increase the financial resources that the EU raises itself, which the Treaties demand we do. 
We need to explain and convince European citizens and our friends in the Council that giving more money to the EU is worth it and that the additional investment is worth it. Let us be confident and ambitious, as the European people have demanded we be, within this budget and the next.
