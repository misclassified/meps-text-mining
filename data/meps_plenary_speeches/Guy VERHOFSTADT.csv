Guy VERHOFSTADT,2023-11-21,EN,Proposals of the European Parliament for the amendment of the Treaties (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-21-INT-2-266-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt,  rapporteur. – Mr President, first of all, I want to thank also the Spanish Presidency for being here for this debate. It is much appreciated. We all have to recognise that since the approval of the Lisbon Treaty, that was quite a number of years ago, the world has changed dramatically. We have since then, over the last years, lived in a brutal world – the world of what I call empires – in which the sovereignty of the peoples and countries of Europe can, in my opinion, only be secured through an enlarged European Union and a more enhanced European Union. 
I think that we have to be, in this debate today, honest with ourselves. That is, that we are for the moment, not ready for this more brutal world in which we have entered and also not ready for the absolute need for an enlarged European Union to 35 or 37 Member States. Certainly not with Russia that continues its aggression, or maybe with – hopefully not – a return of Trump in the White House next year. 
The key problem that we face in our Union is that too often we react too little too late, because we are paralysed by the request for unanimity in our decision-making. I will not give the whole list, the list is long, but a few examples. It has now been months that we have not been capable of deciding on a 12th sanction package against Russia. We are not capable of refinancing the European Peace Facility to send new weaponry to Ukraine because of unanimity. And we were for a decade not capable of doing something against illegal migration because we enclosed ourselves in unanimity. 
So vetoes and blackmail have become in the European Union, I would say, the standard practice. And if we find a consensus, then we go to the General Assembly of the UN and then we vote one third in favour, one third against and one term third abstains. 
So the question with this report is how to change this. The passerelles, dear colleagues, let’s be honest, have failed. And the reason they have failed is that because there is not one smaller or medium Member State, not even Spain, Poland or Italy, who is ready to give up its veto to strengthen, in fact, the de facto combined veto right of France and Germany under the current rules. 
Therefore this report, I think, is critical and important because we will fundamentally change this by creating a qualified majority by two thirds of the Member States, representing 50% of the population, and dramatically increasing doing so the position of small- and medium-sized Member States. 
We introduce also reinforced qualified majority for important decisions, like, for example, the budget, own resources or the coming into force of Treaty modifications. I think that this way is the way to overcome the unanimity trap in which the European Union has come and fall in for years now. 
In the same spirit, what this report is doing is also reforming Article 7, giving an enhanced role to the European Court of Justice, so that maybe it can work in the future. Enhancing also subsidiarity to the national parliaments and the regional parliaments with legislative power by giving a green card, which does not exist today. And then also increasing European democracy by giving more power to our Parliament, for example, the possibility to take initiatives or also to decide on the income side of the budget and finally, new competences like in defence, health, energy and climate change. 
I want to conclude, Mr President and dear colleagues, by saying let us not make a mistake when we vote tomorrow. And I say that especially to those who are today, by Twitter and by other means, attacking this reform of the European Union. This report will not change the Treaty overnight. This report does not create a European superstate, which is completely ridiculous if we remember that the budget of the European Union is 1% of the European GDP – I do not think with 1% of European GDP, dear colleagues, that we are a superstate. 
The truth is that the approval of this report is needed to start the process, to make use of Article 48, so that the European Council can start the work, so that we can enlarge the Union, we can further unify the continent and be ready for the huge challenge ahead of us. And I would ask you, do not miss that historic opportunity tomorrow.

So, that is a good sign.
But on unanimity, it is a little bit strange that this criticism comes from the Polish side, on the abolishment of unanimity, because Poland knows what damage unanimity can do. Your country even disappeared for decades because of the unanimity that existed in the Polish Parliament. That completely undermined the existing of the Polish State. So, you will be the first in fact to defend the end of unanimity.
I remember very well – if you allow me, Mr President – the discussions on the Lisbon Treaty with President Kaczyński and Prime Minister Kaczyński at the time. They were not very pleased with the outcome of the Lisbon Treaty, certainly not with the whole issue about the 55/65 qualified majority rule. They were against.
What we do here in the proposal is we make the position of small- and medium-sized Member States, and especially of a big Member State like Poland, stronger in the proposal, by saying that you need, in the future, two-thirds of the Member States to approve by qualified majority a proposal, and to lower the 65%, what is in fact a veto for France and Germany, to 50%.
I am pretty sure that if that was on the table at the moment of the Lisbon Treaty that both President Kaczyński and Prime Minister Kaczyński would be victorious and would be happy with such a proposal.
So, maybe you have to reconsider your own attitude in the past a little bit before saying ‘no’ to this important proposal of the European Parliament.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2023-10-04,EN,Need for a speedy adoption of the asylum and migration package (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-04-INT-3-061-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt (Renew).   – Mr President, first of all, to Mr Vandendriessche, who is no longer in the plenary, to say that really using ‘population replacement’ here is a scandal because maybe he doesn’t find a problem, but simply to recall that population replacement has been used by Breivik, for example, as a justification to kill 69 young people in Norway. That’s the reality. 
I have to tell you, Mr Schinas, that personally I think that it’s good that we will have now a deal after eight years, because you, first of all, with the Council, tried to find unanimity between the Member States, even when the Treaty says it is not necessary unanimity. 
But I think that there are two things missing. First of all, a real legal route to enter the European Union, a European legal migration framework based on a blue card and not 27 different systems. The second is giving the possibilities, in my opinion, that people can ask for asylum or refugee status in their country of origin or in the country of transit. 
You know what the drama and the tragedy is? It’s that people need to come to Europe on the European territory to ask for asylum. So why not use our consulates? Why not use our embassies? Why not use opening centres in the countries of origin so there they can ask for asylum and, if it is agreed, then they can enter the European Union. That is missing in your package.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2023-09-13,EN,State of the Union (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-13-INT-3-058-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt (Renew).   – Madam President, I hope that you’re going to be flexible for me, for once, because it’s my last intervention on the State of the Union after 15 years in Parliament and 10 years in the Council.
I have to tell you, Madam President, that I missed something, and I’m really in disagreement with you on one thing.
What I missed was the European Defence Union. And it’s more than the common production of ammunition for Ukraine. Can you imagine if we are in the same situation, in a war with Ukraine, with Trump back as a president and without having the backing of NATO? So the European Defence Union is absolutely clear and necessary for the future.
The second thing, where I am in complete disagreement with you – and you are the first President of the Commission who has tried to do that – is your suggestion to decouple the enlargement of the European Union from the deepening of the European Union. Yes, you said ‘let’s try with 30, with 35, with 36’. I can tell you, look at a European Union before your eyes with 35, 36 Commissioners or something like that – we already have no tasks for them today with 27! Or secondly, can you imagine the European Union with still the unanimity rule? You said, ‘Yeah, but we managed it.’ You managed it? Let’s give the examples. Migration we managed, it’s a breakthrough, because we skipped the unanimity, because for seven years the Council said ‘We’re going to do it with unanimity. It’s better than with qualified majority’, even when in the Treaty it’s foreseen by qualified majority. So the breakthrough came because we skipped unanimity and the same in sanctions.
And Mr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, is right. He is saying that the counteroffensive of Ukraine goes at the speed of light compared to the sanction policy of the European Union. We are not capable anymore of deciding on additional sanctions against Russia because of unanimity in the European Union – because one or two countries oppose it.
So I think we absolutely need this reform of the Treaties and in my opinion, I ask in any way the Spanish Presidency by the end of the year when they open the negotiations with the candidate Member States not to do it if at the same time we don’t also open the debate on the reform of the Treaties.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2023-09-12,EN,Iran: one year after the murder of Jina Mahsa Amini (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-12-INT-2-315-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt (Renew).   – Mr President, High Representative Borrell, you know that I like you very much and also that I applaud the courage that you have got in the Ukrainian file.
But I have to tell you – and the proof, you have listened to it – nobody likes your position on Iran. That’s the reality. The reasons are very clear. Let’s be honest, the policy and the strategy of Europe towards Iran is purely symbolic. It has nothing to do with stopping the regime. The so-called critical engagement; what does it mean? Two hundred and twenty-six people have been sanctioned by the European Union for human rights abuses. For the help of Iran to Russia, twelve people have been sanctioned. Twelve people. That is the only thing that’s happened.
In the meanwhile, the Revolutionary Guard is still not a terrorist organisation. So, I can tell you one thing. This Parliament wants another approach. My request will be, Mr President, that in two months we put this file, in November, again on the plenary of this Parliament. So we can see that you change your strategy and that you can also convince your colleagues – ministers of foreign affairs, because I know it’s not only you who is responsible for it – for a new course, because what is happening in Iran is a scandal. It’s a regime of murderers and criminals, and we have to be really tough with them.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2023-07-12,EN,"Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 29-30 June 2023, in particular the recent developments in the war against Ukraine and in Russia (debate)",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-12-INT-3-049-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt (Renew).   – Mr President, I want to come back to the absence of the Council here, because we all know why they are not here, the leaders of the European Union, because they are in Vilnius in the NATO summit. What do they have to do in the NATO summit? Nothing at all. The EU is not a member of NATO, in my opinion. But the photos are there and they are in search of a new Secretary General for NATO for next year. So there they are and not here in Parliament to answer the questions that we have.
On top of that, Mr President, what they are deciding there in Vilnius is nothing at all, because they are putting Ukraine again in a waiting room. That is not a wise decision, in my opinion, because it gives the impression for Russia that they can continue the war. The longer they continue the war, the longer Ukraine will be outside NATO.
Let’s not make this mistake here in Europe. My proposal is that, after the summer break, as fast as possible, the Commission comes forward with a proposal to open the negotiations with Ukraine as a member of the EU.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2023-06-13,EN,Negotiations on the European Electoral Law (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-402-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt,  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Minister, it’s one year that the Council has a letter about Article 48 and the launch of a convention and we didn’t receive a reply. It’s more than one year that you have the electoral law approved by Parliament and you have still no common position. But you are capable to send us a letter about the composition of Parliament; on the future composition of Parliament, we need to make progress. I find that you have guts to do that. 
So, one year and you are not capable to respond to Article 48, what is by a simple majority in the Treaty. You are not capable to respond to have a common position on the electoral law, but on the composition it needs to go fast, fast, fast. I can tell you one thing: I think there will be a link between all this, one day or another. 
The best way forward is not to send these letters. The best way forward will be that the President of the Council, the rotating presidency, takes contact with the President of Parliament and starts to have a meeting about the global issue that we have on the table. And that is the request on the convention, that is the electoral law and that is the composition of the Parliament. And the longer you are waiting with that, the more problems we will have and the more problems you will have and the next Presidency will have. The faster you propose, together with Ms Metsola, a common meeting about this, the faster we will have a solution for all these files, if that is an advice that I can give you.

I think they have enormous courage to go back to their country, to Russia, to fight for a free and democratic Russia after they have been poisoned by Putin –both of them. 
I have to tell you that I would not have this courage, very honestly, to return in such circumstances. But the question is, are we courageous here in these two cases? I have to tell you, President, that we have sent with a number of colleagues, already on 6 April, a letter to the Commission, to Mr Borrell, asking for Magnitsky sanctions the fastest as possible in the case of Vladimir Kara—Murza. That’s from 6 April. The Americans have already two months ago taken Magnitsky sanctions in that case – and we are still waiting.
So what I ask, Mr Commissioner, is that the Commission and Mr Borrell come forward, with the Council, with the Foreign Affairs Ministers, with Magnitsky sanctions in the case of Vladimir Kara-Murza, in the case of Mr Navalny and in the case of all these political prisoners, the fastest as possible. 
I ask, we will ask – and we will have a majority in this parliament – that the point is again on the agenda in May or in June. We expect then that these packages will be announced in the coming weeks. Otherwise, in my case in any way, I will cancel my trust in the European leadership of today.

I was pleased that you got COVID. I was pleased that you got COVID a few days ago and that you didn’t go to China because it only add more cacophony to the positions of Europe on China. So very well that you stay at home. But I have a request you: it’s your task to come forward now with a new strategic paper.
You know, the strategic paper on China dates from 2016. 2016! I know! Then we added we actualised the paper of 2016, Mr Bütikofer, in 2019. And then in the meanwhile, what happened, is everything what happened in Hong Kong, because everybody is talking about Ukraine, but things changed fundamentally when? At the moment of Hong Kong, because the consensus worldwide was ‘one China, two systems’. And if China doesn’t accept any more two systems, why we should accept one China? It is the one or the other. So my plea to you is to come forward as fast as possible in the three months from coming with a new communications strategy paper on China, sending it to the Council, sending it to the European Parliament, and to define this new strategy, as fast as possible. That is what we need to do.

C’est une démocratie, la France. Il ne faut pas l’oublier. En plus, pour qu’il n’y ait pas de malentendu, Madame Aubry, s’il y a des ripostes policières exagérées, je vais être le premier à les dénoncer et aussi à les condamner. Mais cela reste naturellement des ripostes. Cela veut dire une réaction à d’autres violences qu’on a vues sur nos télés. C’est ça la réalité. Et des violences qui sont, et ça c’est encore plus grave, Madame Aubry, parfois encouragées par des partis politiques aujourd’hui en France.
Des gens qui disent: «N’écoutez pas les élections, ce n’est pas légitime. Ce qui est en fait le plus important, c’est la censure populaire, pas la majorité parlementaire. Eh bien, vous faites des gestes, Madame Aubry, mais j’ai quand même, une fois, regardé votre compte Twitter.

Without the help of the Americans, this war would be already over and in the wrong direction, with the wrong result. We don’t have a European defence community. And so, what I hope is that the Commission comes forward, as fast as possible, during the war, by the end of the war, with a strategic concept of creating a European defence community. It’s not because you buy together in the EPF some weapons that you have a European defence community. It’s a good measure, but it’s not enough. The training of soldiers, it is good that we do that. But that’s not a European defence community. A European defence community is putting together the EUR 250 billion we spend on defence. We spend 30% of the Americans on defence and can only do 10% of the operations of the American Army. Why? Duplication, duplication, duplication. One hundred and thirteen weapon systems – the problem in Ukraine today. Also in ammunition.
And so what the European Commission and the European institutions and the European Council have to do is, as fast as possible, before the end of the war, come up with a strategic concept for European defence – not in contradiction with NATO, but as the European pillar of NATO. That has to be the lesson of this brutal war and this invasion of Russia in Ukraine.

I think, personally – and I hope that everybody can agree – that it’s an important sign of recognition after we as Parliament – you remember that – honoured him with the Sakharov Prize. And again, I think that with this award, the world recognised that Russia and its autocratic regime is a threat to all who want to live in peace and stability and democracy and with human rights, whether they live in Russia or outside Russia. I think that Parliament, during this session, has to stand by them and to put back on the table the liberation of Aleksei Navalny and with them of all political prisoners, first of all of Belarus, like Ales Bialiatski, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, or, for example, political prisoners in Georgia, such as former President Mikheil Saakashvili, such as Russia’s Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is in prison, Aleksei Gorinov, and many others arrested for speaking out against the war in Ukraine. I can tell you that families and supporters of the last three are visiting the European Parliament this week, so let’s welcome these families with wholehearted support and put the entire weight of a democratic Europe behind their causes.

After everything what he said he should go to Kramatorsk, maybe, where yesterday, again, an apartment block was brutally attacked and destroyed by Russia. The only way to end this war is a victory of Ukraine. That’s the way to end the war the fastest as possible.
And for that – I hope Mr Hahn that you are in direct contact with Ms von der Leyen, I suppose, on what she will do in Kyiv – my impression is that it is a weak proposal what you are bringing to Kyiv. On weapons, for example, I see no long—range missiles in the package. On sanctions, Mr Séjourné has said it, it’s already a year that we are asking to put the full backbone of the Russian Putin regime on the sanctions regime. And the Commission is not moving on that. The same on the assets, the frozen assets of the Russian central bank. It’s possible to seize them, to freeze them and to transfer them to Ukraine. That’s possible. There is the legal service of the Council, Mr Hahn, that’s something that cannot be disputed. And they have said that it is possible.
And finally, a fast—track membership to 2026. If I see what is happening on corruption in Hungary, I think, and I see the actions that are happening in Ukraine, Ukraine deserves a place in Europe.

You have to stop to think that with the progressive packages of sanctions, as we are doing already now for ten months, that we’re going to have success. The Council is saying it is going well with the sanctions. For me, the sanctions will only have a positive result when the Putin regime stops what is happening in Dnipro – that is a positive result of sanctions. Therefore, we don’t need progressive packages, as we have seen. I said it already to your colleague, Mr Borrell, nearly ten months ago: with a dictator, with an authoritarian regime, if do you do a package of sanctions they adapt themselves and everything goes on. So we are now preparing a tenth package. In total – as Mr Gahler has said – of the 6 700 people identified as the backbone of the Putin regime by the Navalny Foundation, the EU as the External Action Service – Mr Borrell and the whole Commission – has as yet been capable to issue personal sanctions to 1 400 of them, of the 6 700. And that list has existed for nearly ten months already and is on the table of the EEAS for ten months already. 
The second thing is secondary sanctions. There are still companies and individuals making deals and doing business in Russia. I ask you, as fast as possible, to declare secondary sanctions on this, because that’s the only possibility to stop it. 
The last point is the 320 billion that is frozen in Russian banks. Why not transfer that money directly? Russia is a terrorist state. So they do not need to have the reserves of their Russian central bank. That money could be mobilised immediately, even for buying arms. 
Finally – sorry but I’m speaking for 112 colleagues so you have to give me some additional room to do so – on arms, it’s clear what we need now. If Europe wants to do something positive on this, well then it’s long—range missiles next to tanks – then it is long—range missiles so that tragedies like Dnipro can no longer happen.

That is, in my opinion, the sanctions and the weapons that Ukraine needs to end this war the fastest as possible. 
You can all talk about price caps on oil and gas, but the best way to end the energy crisis is to end the war. For that, Ukraine needs to win the war. There, for the moment, what we see is that weak sanctions create weak results. It’s ten months and what we see is an escalation of brutality of Russia in Ukraine – rape, genocide, deportations of children in that country. 
So what I want and expect of the European Council is that, first of all, you start a decision to give more weapons. These discussions about Patriots, about Leopards, of the European governments is a scandal! You need to send them, to transfer them to Ukraine so that they can win the war. 
The second item is on sanctions – there are still, dear colleagues, 11 oligarchs of the most important oligarchs not on the list of sanctions in Europe. In total, after the ninth package – remember you are already on the ninth package – there will be 1 400, 1 500 or maybe 1 600 on the sanction list and, in total, there are 6 000, 7 000 people that need to be on the sanction list, because they are the real backbone. 
The same for Iran. Will you discuss, in fact now, sanctions for Iran? Can we still support Iranian diplomats on the territory of Europe, dear colleagues? We need to expel them the fastest as possible from Europe. That is what we need to do, and that is what I expect: sanctions and weapons for Ukraine and sanctions against Iran at the next European Council.

That’s even a more important problem. So it’s not only a question of saying, ‘Yeah, but finally, in the European Union, after six months, nine months, one year, two years – the migration package is already seven years but OK, that’s only an exception maybe – we find the solution. No, it’s not about that. It’s also about the time you lose. How you manage Europe in the modern world if you need seven years to agree on a migration package. If you need six months to agree on some sanctions in the case of a war against Ukraine, that’s the problem.
And that, apparently, Mr Bek and the Czech Presidency and the whole Council doesn’t want to understand. Now they are saying, ‘Look, it’s going better because the last packages prove that it is working’. Some people are even waxing lyrical about the agreement that has been found in the beginning of this week. In fact, what is happening is that two evident files with no contestation – the 80 billion loan to Ukraine and a minimum tax on multinationals – are traded against two disputable concessions to Orbán: the approval of his recovery plan on the one hand, and then lowering the frozen amount from 6.3 to 5.8 billion. Well, I predict you something. I predict to you this at this moment that this is not the end, Mr President, of this file. What Orbán will do is to continue every new file in 2023 or to lower that amount, or to escape completely on the rule—of—law mechanism. This is not the end of the blackmail. It’s only the start of the blackmail, the agreement that you have found.
So, I think it’s high time to abolish vetoes. We have done, you have done, President Metsola has done a request based on Article 48. What I ask for is a little bit of respect of the Council towards the Parliament. If the Parliament – based on the Treaties, on Article 48 – is asking for a convention, at least that they have respect for the Parliament and answer that request, and are saying yes or no. For me it’s the same. Say no, say no against the citizens of the European Union, who in the Conference on the Future of Europe asked for such a convention and abolishing unanimity, but at least show respect for the only democratically chosen institution of this continent.

The only thing that you have to do, Mr Dzhambazki, is say ‘yes, I agree with you’!

Because everybody can see today what is happening with national vetoes, on every file. More and more of these files are blocked today. The last days, the last weeks: migration strategy, Schengen, electoral law, energy, price cap on gas, taxation policy, the minimum rate on multinationals, further sanctions and further financial aid to Ukraine, where we need to find now a solution with 26 instead of a solution inside the Union.
So it’s clear that, in my opinion, vetoes are an instrument for blackmailing the Union, and it is increasing for the moment. I know that we asked for a convention to seriously discuss this. And again, due to the lack of consensus, the Council is not in a position to respond to that request. So I know that we have a discussion on Wednesday with the European Council, but it’s only 2 hours. What we are going to discuss is Ukraine, and we’re going to discuss energy.
So I request that we need to urgently debate before the Council on Thursday, and my proposal will be to add that item Wednesday afternoon as the second point on the agenda.

Eight months, and I have still not seen a coherent plan by the European Commission. I find it hugely disappointing because your job is not to come up with a fragment approach but with a global structural approach. And there isn’t one. You are talking about price caps, okay. You’re talking about windfall tax. But what is the whole picture? What will you do to tackle this energy crisis? 
I think you have to do three things. That is an energy purchase platform that is completely different to what you are doing now. You will buy together 15% in 2023 – it is the opposite of what you have to do, to buy together 85%. Where is the security fund for the investments that we absolutely need? And where is the energy assistance plan for households or companies, the same as we did with COVID-19? Why do we not repeat it now? 
You are right when you criticise in this op-ed the German approach with the 200 billion but it is not only necessary to criticise it, you have to also to come forward with an alternative. And we are going to do that with a number of MEPs. In a few moments, we are going to send you a letter about it, with these cross-party proposals.

They are winning the propaganda war.
If you look to our social media for the moment, what you see is more and more posts echoing the narrative of the Kremlin. And the narrative of the Kremlin is that this is a war that was started by us to punish Russia. And that everything that is happening with the energy crisis today is not the consequence of the war, but the consequence of the sanctions and the measures we are taking. 
And I know that there is an aid package – Mr Schinas, you have said here everything that needs to be done, but in the aid package, there is nothing about that. In the aid package is a package where we increase the sanctions against Russian individuals from 1232 to 1262, 30 more, mainly people who are involved in the referenda in eastern and south Ukraine. But nearly nothing about the celebrities, the influencers, the opinion leaders, the propagandists. 
Already on 29 June we sent, together with the Navalny Foundation, a list of 135 people that are the core of the propaganda machine of Putin to the External Action Service. And you know how many have been sanctioned? Two of them! And since the aid package, four more. We are at six now of this 135. One is Dugin, for evident reasons, and three musicians, three singers. That is what we have done, six in total. 
So my question is: if it is all true, what you are saying, why are the Commission and the Council not going after the core of the propaganda machine, tackling the 135 people in Russia? 
And secondly, if we talk about countering Putin, and the Putin propaganda machine inside our own European Union, let us not make agreements, government agreements and government coalitions with the cheerleaders of Putin like Mr Salvini or Mr Berlusconi even. But Mr Salvini was even better with his T-shirt on the Kremlin showing his support for Putin.
Well, you are from the PPE I think, Mr Schinas, maybe it’s a good moment now to say to your friends in the PPE, not to make a coalition agreement with these cheerleaders of Putin in Italy.

Attaquer la présidente de la Commission, qui serait responsable de l’inflation, qui serait responsable de l’augmentation des prix, quand tout le monde sait que c’est la guerre en Ukraine avec Poutine, et que c’est eux qui défendent Poutine et sympathisent avec lui depuis des années… Il faut avoir du culot pour le faire! Et ils sont même payés, peut-être? Je ne sais pas ce qu’il y a sur la liste des Américains. ça ne m’étonnerait pas si le nom de Mme Le Pen et celui du Rassemblement national étaient sur la liste des Américains, payés par les Russes. 
That said, Madam President, I thought there was one black hole in your speech – not so big as those were discovered for the moment, but – that is the absence of defence, because I think really that we are going to live in a total new world order, with huge problems for our security. And you never know what happens if tweeting Trump is returning in the US, then we will be on our own for our own security. So a defence community is an absolute necessity.
We are spending today EUR 240 billion on defence in Europe, the same amount as China, four times more as Russia. We have 130 weapons systems in Europe. We have a world record of soldiers in the world – 2.4 million. And we are powerless. That’s at least the sentiment of most people.
So my request to you is when we have a convention, and thank you for supporting it so clearly, we need to talk also by that and we need to come forward with, I shouldn’t say a copy, but a draft like the Treaty of Paris of 1952, negotiated by Adenauer, de Gasperi and Robert Schuman. That’s the way forward. Don’t forget it. And fill the black hole, please.

That’s true. But if it is a long-term exercise, Prime Minister, you have to start early. Certainly to be ready for 2024. And as you know, the President of the Parliament has triggered Article 48, has sent you a letter, and my request to you and the request of the whole Parliament is that you react smoothly and swiftly to that request. It’s a limited request – to end unanimity and the national vetoes in the European Council because the war in Ukraine shows very well that that is the problem in the European Union for the moment. We need three months to have an oil embargo in the European Union – three months to decide that, because of national vetoes. 
We have no agreement now on this minimum taxation, a multilateral agreement in an international framework, because of the blackmail and the veto of whom? Of Hungary. And at the same time we have the whole migration package in limbo because of what? Of national vetoes. So the war is showing that that needs to change. 
So, my request to you is to smoothly say yes to the request of the Parliament to have a convention and not to play games about that, Minister – like yesterday preparing a letter with the other Member States, with a silent procedure, and saying, yeah, but, we wait for a more bold proposal of Parliament or Article 48. So the Council is now saying we cannot say yes to the limited proposal because they ask for a bold proposal! That’s playing games, Minister. Say yes to what the President of the Parliament has asked for. Don’t only use the words of Havel, act as Václav Havel.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2022-06-09,EN,The call for a Convention for the revision of the Treaties (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-09-INT-4-011-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt,  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, for those who are still doubting if they are going to vote for this resolution, let me maybe recall what happened last week in Europe concerning the sanctions. The Americans, when the war started on 24 February, were capable immediately, three weeks after that, to launch – by an Executive Order of President Biden – an embargo on oil, on coal and on gas. And they did that on 8 March, so the war started 24 February, and 8 March, by an executive order, the Americans were ready to stop the funding of the war machine of Putin. 
You have to compare that with the way we in Europe have handled that same issue. For us, it has taken three months to come to a conclusion. It was on, I think, 4 May that Ms von der Leyen said, ‘yes, I have a proposal’ – two months after the Americans, and then it has taken three weeks, nearly a month, to decide on it, and it will be implemented by the end of the year. And there will be an exception for a number of Member States, especially for Hungary, because of unanimity and the veto right. That is the reality of today. Europe is not fit for the world of tomorrow. The world of tomorrow is not a world of nation states, dear colleagues. The world of tomorrow is a world of empires. Whether you want it or not, China is an empire; India is an empire; the US is an empire; Russia wants to be an empire. In such a world, only a European Union that is not based on unanimity, not based on veto rights, not based on such an instrument can survive. 
Therefore, I think we did a good thing to ask for a convention, Article 48, and to concentrate on the main issue that blocks the Union for the moment – and that is this unanimity rule, the veto right that exists today in our Treaties. 
I think the two articles that we have mentioned are not the only articles I hope that we as Parliament will want to reform, but we will have the chance to discuss that in the Constitutional Affairs Committee. But at least giving up the veto right in sanctions, creating a passerelle clause that was never used – it was created in the Nice Treaty – it has never been used since the moment that it was in the Treaties. 
By launching a possibility to have, with qualified majority, a passerelle clause, I think that it is absolutely needed to survive with the European Union in this 21st Century. So I hope for a massive ‘yes’ for the call for this convention to make that a reality.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2022-05-03,EN,The follow up of the Conference on the Future of Europe (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-03-INT-2-200-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt,  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam Chair, I’m very grateful for this debate on the follow-up of the conference, because I think, in fact, that we cannot allow this conference, after one year of work, after this innovation, of the involvement of the citizens, and with the publication of a beautiful document – that is then classified vertically, I should say. That is also what the co-chair, Dubravka Šuica, and myself said at the end of the conference. 
Therefore, I think that what we as Parliament need to do is to keep the lead in this and to see where the conclusions of the conference can be implemented immediately, as we already did today with the vote on the transnational lists. Let’s remember that. Because let’s be honest, it was a recommendation of the citizens and it was a conclusion of the conference. Let’s not forget it!
But OK, OK, we will not redo the vote from a few moments ago, but we need to do that on every topic and there are a number of topics that require treaty change. When you talk about the health union, to make it a shared competence, you need the treaty change. That was also in the recommendation of the citizens. When you want a real energy union, you need a change of the treaties – because an energy union, we don’t have one. We have not one energy mix that is decided at European level and we don’t have a common purchase of energy decided at European level. So therefore, we also need a change. When you want to end unanimity in a lot of areas, you need to change. When you want to give the right of initiative to the European Parliament, you need a change. 
So, I think it’s obvious that the only way to be true to the conclusions of the conference is to call for a convention – a convention, Article 48, a convention in which we are going to say exactly what articles need to change and how they need to be changed. I hope that, if Parliament votes in favour of this with a big majority tomorrow, then on 9 May, there will also be a positive response from the Council, and that we can go in the direction that is absolutely key and needed: a real union, capable of acting and not always acting too little too late, as has been the case until now. 
So I hope anyway for a big majority in the House, for the follow-up, the approval of the results of the conference and the goal of the convention, Article 48.

It’s a huge legislative file that we have prepared that is an overhaul of the electoral system on the 8th, on transnational votes, on a democratisation for the Spitzenkandidaten on the election day, on everything. 
I want to thank especially Sven Simon for his intervention. I have older bottles in my cellar, but I will wait until the votes are sent to open them, so we will see. 
So let there be no hesitation for those who believe in Europe to vote in favour of this. I know that Mr Annemans’ idea people vote against. He’s against Europe. He’s against the European demos. He will say it himself, he has another opinion about Europe in any way and in any way, a Europe that is not based on transnational list and on a European demos. That’s the reality. 
And I want all those who have hesitations to reflect on that. Listen to Mr Annemans and you will know why you will vote in favour of this file in a few moments, in a few seconds. Don't follow those in fact who don’t want a European demos and who think that democracy can express itself by simple addition of national democracies.
By the way, this file doesn’t abolish national democracy. What we have is we give two votes to the people, one vote on European level to vote for his own representative in the European Parliament, national representative on the parliament, and then a second vote to express the European concerns, the European challenges that are at stake.
And the most important point of this side, and I think Sven Simon has quietly underlined it, is this is also to avoid the catastrophe – may I say that? – of 2019. In 2019, when the Parliament was an outsider, I should say, in the designation, the nomination of the leading figure of the European Union, the President of the Commission. By this system, there will be a democratisation of the Spitzenkandidat. There will be votes for the Spitzenkandidat, and it will be impossible in my opinion, dear colleagues, that the Council will choose somebody else, will nominate somebody else than the Spitzenkandidat who has won the elections in 2024. 
That is what is at stake, with the balance between big Member States, small Member States and medium Member States. So for those who are still hesitating, this is in fact an historical and existential file for Europe and for the European project.

Well, we, especially in Domènec’s report, have taken that as the basis for the proposal, so making a balance between the Member States so that that argument that you have used, with right reasons, doesn’t exist anymore. 
Second point: the second point is that you cannot put that in that file in the electoral law. Therefore, it is in the recital. And in the recital we explain very clearly what the engagement is of this Parliament, that we will never designate, nominate, a President of the Commission who has not been a lead candidate – lead candidate on this transnational list.

And you know that letter Mr Borrell? Because let’s be honest, I can only join those who felt completely devastated about what is happening in Bucha and Mariupol. But let’s be honest, that cannot be the centre of our debate. The centre of our debate needs to be whether the strategy that we are following is the right strategy? Is it stopping the war? Is it stopping Putin – yes or no? What is our strategy? Our strategy, Mr Borrell, and it’s a pity that Mrs von der Leyen is not there, or Mr Michel is not there anymore because they are responsible for that. It’s the strategy of progressive packages, of sanctions. 
We are now in the fourth and now announced today the fifth package. The first four package didn’t work. The value of the ruble went up at the end. And I predict you something, Mr Borrell, the fifth package will not work either. And therefore, we have sent with 212 people and mapped this letter to you. Because, it will not work and people in the corridors tell me ‘Mr Verhofstadt, you are impatient. Wait a little bit. We are working on the sixth package already and in the sixth package you’re going to have all as you want’. Well, I can tell you, I can wait my whole bloody life for your packages. But the Ukrainians who are dying in Mariupol and Bucha cannot wait anymore. That is the reality of the work here. 
You know why your strategy doesn’t work? Because progressive packages of sanctions with an autocrat do not work. That works with a democracy, with Democrats. We have a public opinion, a real public opinion. In Russia there is no longer a real public opinion. The reality is that it doesn’t work because the fifth package is what? coal! It’s ridiculous! It’s only 3% of the imports from Russia. Switch the ban. Ridiculous. More than 50% of the financial institutions are still outside the ban. And the oligarchs, the oligarchs, – shall we extend a little bit? – the oligarchs. The oligarchs will escape finally the sanctions or lose a little bit of their money. You need to tackle the 6000 people around Putin, the real people working with Putin. And we have the list. Alexei Navalny’s Foundation for combating corruption has made the list of 6000 people. These people you need to tackle. 
And so I have a request for you. I’m sorry that I am saying it to you, because I think that for 90% you agree with me, in fact. I’m pretty sure about that. So I wanted to say that to Michel and von der Leyen – in the name of this 212, it’s time to change your strategy. It’s time to have an extra European Council as fast as possible and to go for the full package of sanctions immediately so that you can really make a difference. All the rest will not work. All the rest will prolong the war. All the rest will be more killings on the Ukraine side. 
And finally, a little advice to my friends in Germany. I think that after the horrors of the Second World War, there has emerged (I’m finishing) a strong and democratic Germany, a very strong and democratic Germany. But from such a Germany, I expect leadership, leading by example and not the dragging of feet, as we are seeing today.

Let’s say it here in the House: Estonia was one of the first countries, if not even the first country, to send weaponry to Ukraine. You are showing that in these dramatic circumstances, smaller countries in our Union count and can lead by example. So thank you very much for that. 
But for the rest, let’s not pat ourselves on the back. The sad reality, dear colleagues, is that we are not doing enough for Ukraine today. A no-fly zone is not on the radar. Our financial sanctions are only targeting seven Russian banks. That’s 30% of the Russian banking sector. And most importantly, there is still no ban on Russian oil and gas. 
Ukraine is fighting for European values and for our democracies while we Europeans continue to finance the war machine of Putin’s evil. So, in my opinion, it’s time that, after the Americans and also the British, we decide on a full temporary ban on Russian oil and gas for as long as this aggression is continuing. That is what we need to do. 
And yes, we will suffer, but we will survive in the coming months. But it is not clear if the Ukrainians will survive in the coming months if we don’t take that decision and we don’t need – Mr Borrell, it’s not to you that I'm saying this, it’s to the Commission in general – a fantastic strategic paper to lower our dependency on Russian gas. No, that’s for later. What we need now is immediate action and a decision on the European level, to temporarily ban, until the end of the war, Russian oil and gas.

In my personal view, I think there’s an enormous unity in this Parliament. Besides some people on the extreme left who still think that the Soviet Union exists, and besides a part of the extreme right which is financed by Putin, I think all the rest have a huge unity.
I think that the conclusion of this debate, if I can give some advice or make a suggestion, is that we need a more robust strategy of the European Union. It’s true you did your job, and maybe more than is possible with 27 Ministers of Foreign Affairs, but the conclusion of this debate is that we need a more robust stance.
On 20 February 2014 I was at Maidan, when in the morning 49 people were killed by snipers, and I saw in the eyes of these people how they in fact belong to Europe and want to be in the European Union. Their future is there, not with Putin. Even those people who speak Russian in Ukraine don’t want Putin to come in.
So I think we have to be more robust. We need to do more. First of all, maybe use the European Peace Facility to make a common transfer of defensive weapons to them. We could do that. We have the instrument to do that. And finally – and then I will stop, Ms Hautala, because I know that you have a strong instrument with you, your hammer – we also need a pro-Russian agenda. Because Putin is not Russia, and there is an opposition there with Navalny, who needs our full support because, in the end, there will only be stability and security in Europe if there is a democratic Russia at our borders.

Prime Minister, even if you had spoken for an hour, I would have silently listened to you. You didn’t talk about the ruling of the constitutional court because the ruling of the constitutional court is very clear. Article 1 and Article 19 of the Treaty are null and void in Poland and are in contradiction with the Polish constitution. That’s the decision of the constitutional court in Poland. And that is a constitution and a Treaty, Article 1 and Article 19, that you accepted in 2004, that the past government accepted at the moment of the Lisbon Treaty. And you know what these articles –Article 1 and Article 19 – are. Article 1 is an ever—closer union, and Article 19 is the central role of the European Court of Justice. By the way, it is exactly for the same reasons that the hard Brexiteers went out of the European Union – for these two articles, Article 1 and Article 19. 
The sinister game that you are playing is very clear. The sinister game is that you are putting a politicised constitutional court inside Poland, and that politicised constitutional court is criticised by whom? By the European Court of Justice. The way to eliminate the decisions of the European Court of Justice is to take, with the politicised constitutional court of Poland, a decision that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) no longer has a right of decision in Poland. That is what you have done, and what you defend here. You are making references to others, to the French and the Germans, and there is something to say about the German constitutional court and so on, but they never did that. They never said that Article 1 and Article 19 were no longer applicable in Poland, in their country. They never did that. Like I said, the Brexiteers did that. What you have done is, in fact, put an existential threat to your country and, most of all, to the people, to the Polish people, who are the most pro-European people of the entire European Union. That is what you have done.
And that reminds me of something very dramatic in European history, by the end of the 18th century, when a great country like Poland disappears and makes a fatal mix of bad governance, of external threats and the betrayal of conservatives who could not accept a modern Polish constitution at that time. Am I the only one who sees some fatal resemblance here with what is happening today in Poland? So I have to tell you – I know that you are a historian, Prime Minister – so I wanted, in fact, to start my speech and to end my speech with a classic historical book: ‘The March of Folly’ by Barbara Tuchman, because it reminds me of what is happening in Poland today. It starts with a simple decision, and it goes to another decision, and a further decision, and that is when the folly starts. It is not, in fact, people who want that, not the ordinary Polish citizens, it is the ego of big power players who are not thinking what the disaster will be at the end of the story. 
So my wish, Prime Minister, is please, come back from these stupid decisions and end, together with the Polish people, this march of the folly that you have entered in 2015.

So I have, first of all, a question to the Commission, can that be done independently from my speaking time? Because I hear, in the German press, that there is a suspension of the recovery plan of Hungary. But the German press is not the official gazette of the European Union. My question: is this the truth? Has that been done?
(A voice responds ‘I will reply to it)
OK, that is confirmation that you will reply to it. This House has a right to know if there is a suspension of the recovery plan of Hungary; that is a major decision. We also need to know because Ms Von der Leyen didn’t say anything about that this morning in her intervention, and we need to know that. So, that was outside my speaking time, if would allow me.
Saying that, I have followed this debate since this morning, and I’m stunned. I say that to Slovenian Presidency. After three years, closing the university, closing a radio station like Klubradio, going after the judges, the only thing that you can say here is: oh, we got the debate, and it was an interesting debate, and we didn’t apply Article 7 Paragraph 1, because we had no time to do it; we cannot decide.
I think that’s a shame! When are you going to take the only decision that you need to take, that is to request from Hungary to repeal the LGTBI law that had been voted. That is what you have to decide. No, Madam Commissioner, it is not sufficient to hold it on the agenda; there needs to be a decision. Article 7 was launched by this Parliament three years ago. It’s a shame that, after three years, the only thing you have to tell us is: oh, we will come back later on in autumn.

I know that there are still some problems in the Council, but I know your strengths. I think you are maybe the only one who can overcome that in the Council, and there is also good reason to do so, that conference, because it’s not because now that Trump is out and Biden is in that we can do business as usual.
We have reacted better to the COVID-19 crisis in comparison to the financial crisis – which was a disaster, because it took us 10 years to have the Banking Union and it’s still not there.
There are still weaknesses in the European Union. Migration is not solved. The problem of our geopolitical weakness in our relationship, for example, to Russia: not solved. The rule of law: a number of countries not biding by the rules. I think we need this conference urgently and I count on you, Prime Minister, to achieve that in the Council in the coming weeks if possible.

He is criticising the arrest of Navalny, but his master, Mr Salvini, is paid by Mr Putin, like Ms Le Pen is paid by Mr Putin. Half of the ID Group have links with Russia and Putin. 
And it’s not the end. Mr Putin is continuing his in—fight against Europe. Ponder, for example, that this right—wing Twitter thing is now using servers – because they are forbidden in the US – where? In Russia – Russian servers with their extreme right—wing policy. 
So my plea to you, Mr Borrell, is we need, as fast as possible, more sanctions, broader sanctions on more Russians, on the oligarchs. I think, even if I have never said it before, that even Nord Stream 2 has to be reconsidered in that respect.

I think that ultimately there will be a deal, because it is in the interest of both parties to have a deal. In the interest of the UK and also in the interest of the European Union, but let’s be a little bit realistic. Everybody talks now about how someday there has to be a deal possible. Hopefully, yes, but let’s be realistic. It could be that we need all the time to negotiate this the deal.
Then there could be solutions for that. A technical prolongation of the transition, a provisional application of the agreement, or even stopping the clock! That’s also done in such negotiations.
What is now the most important for us all is not to panic from the European side and to fully support our negotiator, Michel Barnier, and to have fair competition in the end. Because it’s about that. 
It will be far more devastating for our companies if the outcome of this negotiation is unfair competition to their disadvantage. That is the reason why we have to continue to be very clear on this. There has to be a level playing field: no unfair competition can be accepted. 
Also on fish. If they want us to eat their fish, well, we have to have the possibility to catch their fish, in their waters. That’s the bit.
One last remark that I want to make, is a request to Michel Barnier, and to the negotiation team, that is to do something on Erasmus. I know the cherry-picking attitude from the Brits, which is in fact devastating for Erasmus, but let’s take a unilateral measure towards the students in Britain that they can continue unilaterally to make use of Erasmus. 
It’s a pro-European generation this young generation and it’s this generation which will bring the UK back inside the European family in the next decades.

Indeed, this is a huge step in European integration, a historic step in European integration – EUR 750 billion in recovery funds paid with the EU’s own resources, financed by eurobonds, and that linked to the rule of law. 
But, let’s also be honest. There is one shadow cast over this and that is the way, naturally, Ms von der Leyen and the European Council have to ‘molest’ European treaties and principles to get over this blackmail by Hungary and Poland. I have here this fantastic opinion from the Legal Service – four paragraphs, no mention of one article of the Treaty, no mention of one court case, and saying exactly the opposite. The reality is that what the European Council did is not a coup d’état, but nearly a coup d’état. I think that the European Parliament anyway has to examine whether or not we go to court over this because there is one thing and I will conclude with that. You cannot save the rule of law in a Member State if you in fact ruin the rule of law of the Union itself.

I think that we are in injury time, like we say in football, in these negotiations, but I’m still optimistic, Mr McAllister, because I do not think that this is like football. Footballers are tired in injury time, but politicians are not. I think that politicians are at their best in injury time. I am still optimistic, because it’s in the interests of both to have this agreement. 
On the rule of law, I want to simply echo what Luis Garicano and my colleague, Valerie Hayer, have said here in the debate. Ms Szydło, and Mr Zanni – sorry they are no longer here – can read the Treaty. The rule of law is not a question of subsidiarity, because that’s what they in fact are saying, that it’s a question of sovereignty. Freedom of expression, freedom of gathering, democracy, that is not a question of subsidiarity. Respect for the LGBT community in your country, that’s not a question of subsidiarity. That’s a value of the European Union, and that’s the reason we have to stick to the compromise we have found, even when I personally don’t think – and I’m grateful for the tenacity of Ms Merkel in still trying to find an agreement with Poland and Hungary – that there is a lot of room for compromise, because already in the text today you need to prove a link between the breach of the rule of law and the accounts of the European Union before the European Commission can act. So, if there is room for making it better, it’s to strengthen the system, not to weaken the system. If it is not possible – I repeat – there is only one way forward, which is enhanced cooperation inside the Treaty, based on Article 226 of the Treaty, like we did with the euro, like we did with Schengen and like we did with the European Patent. That is far better than to cave in to the blackmail of Orbán and Kaczyński.

Why is this a big step? Because we are in fact breaking three long-standing taboos in Europe.
The first taboo was no eurobonds, no recovery bonds – that was impossible. That was the call of the Council and of everybody after the financial crisis. And what we will do now with this programme is launch nearly one trillion of these bonds on the market, and the first bond that has been launched is a huge success.
The second new thing we are doing concerns own resources. I have heard for years ‘no, it’s impossible to have new own resources’ – for 10 years we have fought for that. It’s there and it’s not taxing the ordinary citizen, it’s taxing Google, Amazon, the big tech companies in America, imported products from China, which are in fact bad for our environment, and so on. So I don’t know what Mr Eppink has against taxing Google and Facebook and Amazon – who is against it? Not the citizens, anyway.
And then there is the fact that there will no longer be money for authoritarians.
But I want to give two short warnings. The first is to the Commission. Mr Hahn, tell your colleagues to use now the tools. I hear already in the corridors, ‘now we going to use this and we’re going to try to find out if Hungary and Poland are in accordance with the system’... but you have to do nothing at all, that has already been proved! You have now to use it and not wait two or three years before doing it.
And my second warning is this: let’s not stop the reform of the European Union. There are other things to tackle: the lack of a European Defence Community, the unanimity rule, and the fact that we cannot elect our own leader. In America they can do it – not always easily – but we cannot do it.

On doit s’arrêter de punir les Britanniques, on doit mieux reconnaître la souveraineté britannique mais quand il s’agit des poissons, ce n’est plus le cas, donc c’est vraiment ridicule, c’est n’importe quoi!
It’s the same with Mr Eppink. Mr Eppink is explaining to us that we do not have to do it in a European way, but we have to do a bilateral deal. Every country with the UK. The last time that you did this, you lost New York, I presume, when you got your negotiations with the British.
So, if I have a suggestion to make, Michel, it’s the following. If we make a deal with the British - and I hope that there is a deal in the coming weeks - then we put in this final agreement, in this treaty - it’s an international treaty - a disposition that automatically that treaty ceases to exist if the British don’t follow all the commitments that they have taken, including in the Withdrawal Agreement. In my opinion that is absolutely necessary because otherwise, if there is a deal, if there is an agreement, and the 27 will have ratified it, and they don’t follow their commitments, it will be a huge mess and it again be necessary for 27 decisions by the 27 Member States to stop that agreement. 
So I think that, after what has happened with the Internal Market Bill, it’s in the interest of the European Union to foresee such a disposition in that final agreement as fast as possible. I hope that there is a deal because it’s the only way to secure the Good Friday Agreement, to secure peace in Northern Ireland and to secure our internal market.

Bay ne soit plus là, lui qui donne des leçons à tout le monde, même sur le financement du fonds de redressement, à un moment où c'est lui, M. Salvini, Mme Le Pen et leurs amis autrichiens qui reçoivent de l'argent de M. Poutine. Peut-être qu'il peut s'occuper de repayer l'argent à M. Poutine. Je trouve ça personnellement scandaleux que des gens pareils soient en train de nous donner des leçons, alors qu’ils reçoivent de l'argent pour détruire l'Union européenne. C'est peut-être ce qu’il est en train de faire, je suppose, parce qu'il n'est plus là. 
My proposal, Ms von der Leyen, is that you repeat these 75 minutes of your speech, that I liked a lot, in the Council. Because let’s be honest, half of the issues that you raised are in fact blocked in the Council. 
When we talk about migration, the tragedy in the Moria camp. That’s the consequence of the impossibility to reform Dublin, to reform the Migration Policy. When we talk about Belarus, it’s 40 days after these elections were stolen by Lukashenko and we are not capable of putting sanctions on the table – 40 days later. 
When we’re talking about Turkey drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean, in Greek waters, no sanction, no action at all. When we talk about Hong Kong, when we talk about the minority of the Uighurs, words yes, but sanctions no, action no. 
And when we talk about the rule of law inside the European Union, let’s be honest, it’s 5...6 years that we are talking about that here in Europe and in the European Parliament. There are no sanctions against these authoritarian regimes. 
So my plea to you, is to repeat this as fast as possible, or in 75 minutes in the Council and let’s make a pact, a deal between us, that that is the priority for 2021 next to the Recovery Fund, Mr Frans Timmermans, and to the Green Deal, naturally. That is the priority. To end unanimity, to have a Magnitsky or Navalny Act as Mr Borrell named it. And to have a real rule of law mechanism, because I don’t want it to be that at the end, in a few years, we are calling you not the geopolitical Commission, but the geominimal Commission - that I want to avoid.

I have to tell you that we were with a few lone rangers that, since the outbreak of the financial crisis, started to say that eurobonds and new own resources were needed, and everybody said, ‘impossible, unrealistic, a dream that will never happen. This is Europe.’
Well, it is happening, and so I’m pleased with the outcome of this summit, and I think it’s historic. Yes, it’s historic. The first leap forward was the internal market; the second leap forward was the euro; the third leap forward is the fact that Europe will issue bonds for the first time and will increase its fiscal capacity in a dramatic way. So, I’m pleased and this is historic.
But there are also weaknesses in this plan, let’s be honest. And the most important weakness is due to what? Yes, the rule of unanimity. And that’s the reason why the pan—European projects have been gutted and that the direct transfers to the Member States and the rebates for the frugals are still there.
I think that – I will be very blunt here, in this House, and I think that I’m speaking for the whole House –this House will not give its green light for this package and for the MFF if this is not rectified, if we again do not have these pan-European projects as the priority in the MFF – and it’s easy to do! The easy way to do it is to start with its own resources earlier than foreseen in the plan. In the plan, it’s foreseen for 2023. My proposal is to start in 2021.
And finally, my last point, Madam President, before you use your weapon again against me – like every time. There needs to be a co-decision by Parliament. We’re going to spend and collect EUR 750 billion. That is only possible with democratic control. We are in Europe. We are not in China or in Russia.

I hope that the Council this time can reach an agreement so that we can launch this conference, because let’s be honest, it becomes more and more like the monster of Loch Ness. From time to time it appears, then it disappears, it is more like an illusion, like a fantasy and we must avoid that.
This is serious business, this conference is not one or other little instrument for the European Parliament. This conference is vital, it is crucial for the future of our European Union, because let’s face it, this Covid crisis is another illustration of it. This Covid crisis will change the world. It is a world that will be completely different, a world that will no longer be dominated, I think, by the United States of America who is withdrawing from the international scene for the moment. It may well be dominated by China who wants to become, and who already is, a world power and who wants to dominate the world and international scene. 
Between America and China there will be Europe stuck between them and if we don’t want to be stuck between the US at the one hand and China on the other hand, and if we want really the instruments to defend the interests of our citizens, we need another European Union. This European Union is not fit for purpose. Not fit for the future and we all know it. The Council knows it, the Commission knows it and certainly our citizens know it. So it’s time now to start really this exercise because we have not a lot of time, maybe we can tell that to your colleagues in the Council. There is the Covid crisis, there are precedent crises, tomorrow there could be another challenge. 
So my hope is that we can take a decision to make this common declaration between the three institutions and we can start this conference as early as possible in September.

But I have also seen the first documents circulating in the Commission – and it’s business as usual: it’s old tricks, it’s repackaging, massive frontloading, and then a multiplier – I have seen that the Commission will use a multiplier of 45! Even Jesus in the New Testament was not capable of doing that: a multiplier of 45 when he multiplied the fishes and the bread. But the Commission is on that track, and that’s not, I think, even the opinion just of the Commissioners. That’s typical, in bureaucracy, of how it works.
Ms von der Leyen explained today how they are going to do it: they are going to increase the headroom a little bit and ask more guarantees of the Member States. Well they should not think about doing that. All our Member States will be in deficit. All our Member States will be in debt. You cannot increase the national contributions of the Member States by asking for more guarantees in the future. What we need to do is create a new headroom, and a new headroom that is new own resources. That is not an invention. The financing of the European Union was always based on own resources, on VAT, on customs duties, and what we propose now is a digital tax and other taxes against pollution. It is because of the rebate we gave to Margaret Thatcher that in the 1980s we started to stop with these normal democratic finances and that we started to ask for contributions from Member States. Well it’s a good moment to stop that, definitely, and to create real financing for this Union.
So the problem is not so much, Mr President, where we are going to spend this – in politics that’s easy. The most important problem is how we are going to fund it. I ask the Commission – Mr Šefčovič, tomorrow in your meeting – to ask for new solutions as we have described here in this resolution.

Why? Because I think that, rightly, she has spoken about the duties that our nurses, our medical people are fulfilling. But are we politicians fulfilling our duty? I’m not so sure about that because we have already been discussing this European master plan for many weeks in a row. My question is, what is the European Commission waiting for? Why can she not come forward with this trillion-sized European reconstruction and recovery plan? What is she waiting for? Is she waiting for the European Council? Then we may be waiting eight years, as is the case of the Banking Union, because there is still no banking union after the financial crisis. The European Council is playing ping pong. In February, the Eurogroup could not agree on that plan. They sent it to the European Council. Then in March, the European Council sent it back to the Eurogroup. Then the Eurogroup, in April, a few days ago, was not in agreement with that part of the plan and sent it back to the European Council. 
My message to the European Commission is that this has to stop. You have the right of initiative. Take your responsibility and come forward with what is asked by the whole Plenary here, that is a trillion-sized European recovery and reconstruction plan, not based on mutualisation of that, not guaranteed by the Member States – they have no money anymore, they will all be in deficit – but based on new own resources.
It’s an historical moment for the European Commission. We need a large type of initiative. You remember Delors. There was a big crisis, an economic stagflation crisis, and he launched the single market and it lifted us out of the crisis. The same is needed now. The European Commission has to act and not wait for the outcome of a Council that will not decide next week.

He has kept the unity of the 27, he has kept the unity between the three institutions, and everybody who works in Europe knows that this is not a small achievement. And for that reason, I want – especially for his friendship, for his cooperation – to thank Michel Barnier, our chief negotiator.
(Applause)
At the beginning of this debate, Mr President, I want also to pay tribute to our British colleagues – well, at least the overwhelming majority of them. I have to say to them that they have always brought wit, charm, intelligence (some of them). And, let’s recognise, sometimes also stubbornness in this House. I think that I can say, in the name of all of us, from all Groups, I can only say we will miss you in the coming time and in the coming years.
(Applause)
Mr President, let me be clear from the start of this debate. Today’s vote is not a vote in favour of or against Brexit; it’s a vote for an orderly Brexit against a wild, a hard Brexit. I will be very honest with you: if we could stop Brexit by voting ‘no’ today, I would be the first to recommend it. But that’s not on our plate today. That’s not on our table and not the issue today. It is indeed a sad issue: sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given all of us so much. I mean culturally, I mean economically, I mean politically, even its own blood in two world wars. It’s in fact sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, has twice given its blood to liberate Europe. And I think, Mr President, in these debates we cannot escape a key question: how could this happen? How is it possible that, more than 40 years after, I think, an enormous overwhelming majority of nearly 70% voted to enter into the European family, how 40 years later they decided, based on their sovereign rights, to leave this European project? I have to tell you that, since the outcome of the referendum (and that is now more than 3 years ago), I have heard many opinions about it. Everybody has an opinion about it. Some people are saying: well look, they are simply afraid, the Brits, of losing their sovereignty. That’s the issue. But colleagues, what does ‘sovereignty’ in fact mean today, in a world that is completely dominated by powerhouses like China, like India, like the US; in a world where we have to challenge transnational problems like climate change and the digital supremacy – tomorrow, of China, today of the US?
Let me say it maybe a little more punchily: what is in fact threatening Britain’s sovereignty most – the rules of our single market or the fact that tomorrow there will be, maybe, the planting of Chinese 5G masts in the British Isles? The cruel reality that we have to consider today in this debate is that European countries lost their sovereignty already a long time ago, and that Europe is just the way to regain that sovereignty in the coming years.
There have been other people who told me and Michel Barnier: look, you don’t understand it. It’s all about migration that Brexit is happening: migrants working in British hospitals, migrants working in British universities, migrants working on construction sites in London. While in fact, dear colleagues, these migrants are European citizens exactly like British citizens are: paying taxes to Britain and, in fact, contributing to the future of British society.
Then, finally, there are other opinions, but I will be short today (for once). There are others who are saying, and pointing the finger at us, and saying: yes, the reason for Brexit is simple. You didn’t give enough to Mr Cameron when he came to Brussels and when he requested new exceptions for Britain: exceptions on free movement, exceptions on the question of the political union. Well I have to tell you, Mr President and colleagues today, that, as rapporteur, it’s my personal opinion and my firm conviction that the opposite is true. Brexit started not three and a half years ago. Brexit started long ago, and I think, personally, that Brexit started exactly the day we started giving exceptions: with opt-ins, with opt-outs, with rebates. That’s, in my opinion, the moment the Union ceased to be in union. And it’s also the moment, colleagues, that the discontent about Europe started. All these exceptions, all these vetoes make a union, in my opinion, not capable to act effectively: always acting too little, too late. And it is, in my opinion, this lack of effectiveness that leads to even more discontent. It’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy, with members – one leg in the Union and another leg outside the Union – only looking for the advantages, not for the obligations.
So in my opinion: yes, Brexit is also a failure of the Union. It’s also our failure: we have to recognise that in this debate. And yes, there is a lesson to learn from it, and this lesson, dear colleagues, is not to undo the union, as some are arguing here; no, this lesson is – and we have to learn this from Brexit – to deeply reform the union, to make it a real union in the coming years. That means a union without opt-ins, opt-outs, rebates, exceptions and, above all, without unanimity rules and veto rights. Only then can we act, and only then will we defend our interests, and only then will we defend our values. It is this lack of effectiveness that is the problem that we have seen in Brexit.
I have to tell you – and that will be my conclusion, Mr President – in the last couple of days, I received – maybe as you – hundreds of mails from British citizens saying they desperately want either to stay or to return. And I have to tell you, for once – normally it’s easy for me – but this time I don’t know what to respond, because it’s not in our capacity to decide that. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a responsibility to make sure that the Union to which they will return will be another Union, effective and more democratic. So – and that’s my last sentence as rapporteur, Mr President (thank you for the support): this vote is not an adieu; this vote is, in my opinion, only an au revoir.

That is that, for the first time – nearly 20 years, I think, after the start of the Convention, the three institutions agree again on the necessity for an in-depth reform of the European Union. This is already an important fact because it is 20 years after the start of the previous Convention and, for the first time, these three institutions say, ‘OK, an in—depth reform of the Union is absolutely needed’. I will not contradict or have a debate with Mr Legutko because, in the meanwhile, he is no longer here in the plenary.
The reason why we want this Conference is because there are problems that we recognise in the European Union. When we have Brexit, a big country that is leaving the European Union, it’s difficult to say, ‘Oh, fantastic, we work well’. No, it’s a problem. We have a problem when a big country is leaving the Union and when, five years after the start of the migration crisis, we still don’t have a reform of the Dublin Regulation. We have a problem in the European Union when, ten years after the outbreak of the financial crisis, we still do not have a banking union in the European Union. We have a problem. And when Russians and Americans are deciding everything in our neighbourhood – in Syria and in Libya and in Ukraine – well, we have a problem. In fact, the reality is that, on the international stage, we are mocked by Putin, we are blackmailed by Erdoğan, we are bullied by Trump, and mostly we are ignored by the Chinese Government.
That’s the reason why we want to reform Europe; not because we say ‘we are Europeans and everything is going well’, and it’s over. No, tomorrow it will be a different world tomorrow, dominated by what I call empires, like China, like India, like Russia, like America. That doesn’t mean that we have to become an empire – on the contrary – but we want to defend a Europe in which our children and grandchildren can survive in this new world, which is not the case today. 
We have to do it with a new method, not like in the Convention. In the Convention it went from the top down and at the top, with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the top was something very impressive and present. We have to do exactly the opposite, not in contradiction, but from the bottom up – going up from the citizens so that we can create. After the generation of Monnet and Schuman and after the generation of Kohl and Mitterrand, we need a third movement, a third movement with, I would say, the vision of the first and with the courage of the second generation.

Let’s consult all the citizens in Europe like we did during the elections. That seems to me the best thing to do. Maybe we can ask Mr Sassoli to organise that procedure and maybe I’m a candidate to do that. 
To our British friends, I want to say on Nord Stream – that is a good point that has been made, but Nord Stream is proof of what? It is proof of a lack of European Union, it is proof of the fact that a European energy community does not exist in Europe. So if really those people, like those in the Brexit Party, are anxious about Nord Stream, well, they should create the energy community we desperately need and as fast as possible, colleagues.

I hope that this House, when we vote – I think it’s tomorrow we vote – on this resolution gives it a huge majority, a huge majority that gives us a mandate for the final discussions with the UK authorities, which will happen on Thursday. I have been invited by the Secretary of State, Mr Barclay, and by the new Minister for European Affairs, Mr Pincher. It’s important that this resolution has massive support so that it gives us strength on Thursday and Friday because there are still concerns that need to be addressed. If they are not addressed now, before the end of the month, they will be on the table before the end of the year. I cannot imagine that the European Parliament will agree, for example, on the free-trade agreement (FTA) without solving the problems and the concerns of the EU citizens and the UK citizens, including freedom of movement. 
These concerns have already been mentioned by my two colleagues. First of all, the automatic recognition of citizens’ rights. There is a Tory Government and Tory governments always say that they want less bureaucracy. Well, OK, let’s make less bureaucracy and the best way to do it is automatic recognition so that you don’t need all this. The second is a physical document. Why is it necessary? The UK authorities are telling us that, ‘yes, but it’s not necessary – they have an email’. But can you imagine a case where a woman goes to see her parents on the continent, comes back and at the border they ask, ‘where is your email?’ – ‘I don’t have my email, there is no energy anymore in my battery’ – or maybe she deleted the mail, so she cannot enter the UK. We need a physical document. In a normal world, you have a document. That’s the second concern. 
The third concern is the Independent Monitoring Authority. My proposal is simple: why not put a few representatives of the 3million organisation in the Independent Monitoring Authority? Then we are sure that both sides are there, so it solves the problem. These things need to be addressed and I hope that they will be on Thursday and Friday. 
Maybe, to finish on a lighter note, I can ask Prime Minister Johnson for a little bit of flexibility. Maybe he can follow the Queen’s example – because yesterday the Queen gave Harry and Meghan a transition period to leave, so maybe some flexibility on Mr Johnson’s side could also be very useful.

I’m proud that a Belgian is President of the European Council, instead of all the stupid things you have said. And if you don’t know, dear colleagues: if there is a minority in Belgium, it is the separatist of Mr Annemans who is the minority in Belgium.
To Mr Farage and his troops, I want to say that they make a lot of noise for having zero seats in the British elections. Everybody said here: ‘we will miss our British colleagues of the Lib Dems, of Labour’. Well, I will not miss the Brexiteers going out, I can tell you. I will not miss them. Saying that, dear colleagues, there is a consent to be given by this Parliament. And I know that everybody says and thinks: ‘oh, this consent will be given automatically, because it’s like that’. We have foreseen that this consent procedure will end in plenary on 29 January, but in the meanwhile, there is a problem to be solved. I have received, since the elections in Britain, hundreds and hundreds of letters and emails of British citizens living in Europe, panicking about their status. I have received hundreds of mails of EU citizens living in Britain panicking about their status. And I think we need to solve that first, before we give our consent on this Brexit treaty. Why? Neither citizens, British or Europeans alike, can be the victims of this (in my opinion) not very intelligent choice of Brexit. And I want to appeal to the Prime Minister of Britain, to Boris Johnson, to be generous in his victory and to give to all the European citizens – and the British citizens alike, living on the continent – the full rights as they have today: automatically, to all of them, no ifs and no buts, as he always says, to do so. I want also to tell you that more and more people are coming back to another (and I will conclude with this) issue of European associated citizenship for British citizens who want to continue to feel that they are European, and I think we have to be open to that request.

Guy VERHOFSTADT,2019-10-22,EN,Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 17 and 18 October 2019 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-10-22-INT-2-025-0000_EN.html,"  Guy Verhofstadt (Renew).   – Madam President, first of all, I want to say to Mr Van Orden that I am honoured that you compared me with Mr Bercow. It’s in any way better than to be compared with Mr Rees-Mogg, because Mr Bercow’s ties are more colourful. I like them more than those of Mr Rees-Mogg. 
I want to thank the Conference of Presidents that they have confirmed that the consent procedure in this House will only start after the full ratification by the side of the United Kingdom and that’s important, that was in our resolutions. I think we need to use the time between now and the consent vote to solve the last problems that still exist today which are the rights of the EU citizens that are living in the UK. There are still a number of problems to be solved. There is the vulnerable citizens – 200 000 of them who are in need of assistance. There is those who will miss the deadline, and there one of the members of the UK government has said, oh, we’re going to do deportation. Well, I can tell you this problem needs to be solved in all clarity before, that there is no deportation of these people. There is the difference between a settled status and pre-settled status. What is, in my opinion, not always clear why people are in pre-settled stages are not in settled status with full rights. And there is the Independent Monitoring Authority. It’s not clear in the withdrawal bill how independent the Independent Monitoring Authority will be and we have to be sure that it is a real Independent Monitoring Authority. So, before the House will give consent, I want to see this problem solved. We don’t want that the EU citizens become victims in another Windrush scandal in Britain. That cannot happen. 
Finally, I want to use this intervention also to say some positive things about Jean-Claude Juncker, but already he is not there and especially to Donald Tusk, I want thank him for the cooperation. We never had words with each other during these five years in the debates and I wanted to wish him all the luck in his upcoming challenges, somewhere in a big country in the East of Europe. Good luck Donald.

So who is more democratic, do you think? Who is more democratic? In your own country, neither in UKIP before Brexit has one representative in the British parliament and here you have more than, I don’t know, too many representatives. You’re saying that we are not democratic. This is crazy. 
But that said, I will be less diplomatic than Mr Michel Barnier. I think that the proposal that Boris Johnson put forward exactly one week ago, was not serious at all. Not serious at all because it was, in fact, I call it a virtual proposal. It was not a real proposal. It gives a veto to the DUP in a number of issues. It is putting custom facilities, not on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, but in all the other parts of the island of Ireland that we don’t know yet. And finally, the proposal is to downgrade the political declaration and the future relationship by undercutting, in fact by making a sort of Singapore at the sea, at the North Sea – these 20 behind me like that – , but by in fact destroying the ecological, social and labour standards. I have to tell that to Mr Richard Corbett because he’s a Labour representative. I can never understand that today there are 20 or so Labour MPs thinking to vote together with the government of the UK for such a deal. That’s the contrary of all the things that Labour has always defended in the past. I hope that this is not happening. 
The real reason why this is all happening is very simple. It’s a blame-game. A blame-game against everybody, a blame-game against the Union, against Ireland, against Ms Merkel, against the British judiciary system, against Labour, against the Lib Dems, even against Mrs May. The only person who has not been blamed is Mr Johnson himself, apparently, but all the rest are the source of our problems. That is what is happening today. All those who are not playing his game are traitors or a collaborator or have surrendered. Well in my opinion, the real traitor is he or she who will risk bringing disaster upon his country, its economy and its citizens by pushing Britain out of the European Union. That’s, in my opinion, a traitor.

(Applause)
It’s fantastic that the Brexit Party and Mr Farage are making so much noise because they can’t do it in Westminster anymore, so they have to do it here.
(Applause)
By the way, they are not even elected in Westminster.
(Applause and heckling)
As you know, colleagues, Eurosceptics like something: they like bashing Europe by saying that the European Union is undemocratic. And you can be sure that in a few moments they are going to repeat that. Well, I can tell you that Jean—Claude Juncker and President Tusk can do a lot of things, but at least they cannot close the doors of this House. That is not possible. So if the Eurosceptics, in the coming hours or the coming minutes, again want to make a ridiculous comparison with the Soviet Union, from now on they can point the finger at Westminster instead of at Strasbourg or Brussels. That seems to me to be a good way forward for them now.
My hope is that, with the vote and the resolution today, we will reiterate our unity about Brexit: a unity that means Parliament, that means the Commission, that means the Council and that means the 27 Member States. There is no discussion about this. Brexit is bad. It’s a bad idea, but it has at least one positive effect, and that is to reunite Europeans and to make the European project, since Brexit, more popular again. That is what we have seen in all the public opinion inside the European Union.
(Applause)
In fact, the message of the people during the elections was very clear: reform Europe, don’t destroy Europe, don’t leave Europe. That was the case in all our Member States and it was also the case in Britain because nearly 40 of the 73 elected British MEPs are Remainers today.
(Applause)
That brings me to the main point, namely the outcome, the deal that I think is still possible. We, as Parliament, set three conditions in our resolution and I want to recall those three conditions. The first is to safeguard the rights of our citizens, for the Europeans and the British alike. Today I have to tell you that this has not been achieved. Every day in the British press there are examples of people who have already been living in Britain for a decade – even two decades – and who cannot have this so—called settled status.
So I think we need a fundamental shift in the way the UK Government applies at least that part of the Withdrawal Agreement. What we don’t need is the bureaucratic application that we have now. What we need from the British Government is automatic registration of all our EU citizens. I know – and you know – that Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, very much likes to compare himself to movie characters. Well, concerning citizens’ rights, instead of playing the angry Hulk, I think he should be inspired by another character, the caring nanny in the film Mrs Doubtfire, with the late Robin Williams.
Secondly, I want to come back to the other problem, the Irish backstop – or maybe, Michel, let’s call it something else: if they have a problem with ‘backstop’, we’ll call it a safety net. I think that is something we can certainly agree on. We need such a safety net and not only for economic reasons. The main reason why we need the safety net is to make sure that violence does not return on the island of Ireland. That is the main reason.
(Applause)
And I have to tell you that I find it completely irresponsible of a number of British MPs, especially hardline Tories, not to accept this. I have to say that, as we speak – and I ask Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker if they can confirm this during the debate – there has not been one legally feasible and practical alternative put on the table by the UK at this moment. So, clearly, I have to tell you that the idea in the British press today to limit the backstop to agricultural products is not enough because they represent only 30% or 35%, I think, of the total imports of goods and services across the border.
Also, a backstop cannot be ended unilaterally by Stormont because that is not a safety net: it would be a permanent instrument for blackmail during the coming negotiations. A safety net needs to be a safety net in the hands of both parties, not only of Northern Ireland but also of the European Union.
My final remark is on the future relationship. I think it’s good to repeat this because we are a new Parliament. More than 60% of our Members are new so it’s important that we recall this. It’s good to repeat that this Parliament will never accept an agreement with the UK whereby Britain can have all the advantages of free trade and zero tariffs and not be aligned with our ecological, health and social standards in the future. That will not happen.
(Applause)
I can tell you one thing. I know that there are some people in Britain who think that these Europeans, at the end of the negotiations, will give in. Well, that may be possible, but we are not stupid. That means that we will not kill our own companies. We will defend our own companies, we will defend our own economy, we will defend our single market and we will never accept what people call a ‘Singapore by the North Sea’. That will not happen.
(Applause)
Finally, we all know how Brexit started. It was an attempt by David Cameron to heal the divisions in the Conservative Party and the consequence has been enormous divisions in British society. What we will not allow, as Europeans, is for this Brexit to create turmoil and divisions in our European Union and in our European project.
(Applause)
