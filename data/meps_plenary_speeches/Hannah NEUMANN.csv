Hannah NEUMANN,2023-12-13,DE,One year after Morocco and QatarGate – stocktaking of measures to strengthen transparency and accountability in the European institutions (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-255-0000_DE.html,"  Hannah Neumann (Verts/ALE).   – Herr Präsident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Katar war nicht das erste Land, das mit illegalen Methoden versucht hat, Einfluss auf die europäische Politik zu nehmen, und es wird nicht das letzte sein. Heute werden immer mehr Entscheidungen auf europäischer Ebene getroffen, die für Drittstaaten von besonderem Interesse sind – Finanz- und Investitionspolitik, Handelspolitik, Visapolitik. Und genauso wie unsere Verantwortung hier zunimmt, nehmen Versuche zu, legal – aber eben auch illegal – Einfluss auf uns zu nehmen. Deswegen müssen wir zusätzlich zu den Regeln, die wir dieses Jahr beschlossen haben, zwei weitere Dinge tun.
Erstens: den Laden hier sauber halten. Und ich erwarte, dass jede und jeder hier die Regeln einhält, die wir uns gegeben haben, und dass es endlich auch schmerzhafte Sanktionen gibt, wenn sich jemand nicht daran hält. Und zweitens: die Behörden in Belgien und den Mitgliedstaaten so ausstatten, dass sie dem Ganzen endlich Herr werden – Herr Körner hat die Probleme beschrieben. Damit Drittstaaten es irgendwann gar nicht mehr versuchen – nicht bei uns, nicht in der Kommission, nicht im Rat und auch sonst nirgendwo.

Hannah NEUMANN,2023-12-13,EN,European Defence investment programme (EDIP) (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-385-0000_EN.html,"  Hannah Neumann,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, with EDF, EDIRPA, ASAP, EDIP, EDIS frankly said I’m a bit tired of these acronyms trying to disguise the main problem: Member States are simply not willing to move towards a truly European defence industry and market. The communication on EDIP in February surely won’t change that. But I haven’t given up on EDIS, the strategy, yet. 
Here is what needs to be done. One, let’s pool national defence budgets to buy what we need to guarantee the security of European citizens and that of our closest allies, Ukraine before all. We have to stop competing against each other on the market, because this only increases the profits of the defence industry and decreases the security of Europeans.
Two, let’s work on common technical standards to ensure interoperability and economies of scale, and then subsidies and pooled funds should only go to those who produce and procure along these EU standards.
Finally, we need to talk about arms exports. Currently, we have common rules but very diverging national export policies. This is a constant source of conflict between EU Member States, and it hampers cooperation – and Mr Breton, don’t tell me it’s complicated. I have the solution in the drawer, I have it on my website, please just reach out.
Dear colleagues in the Commission and in the Council, if you want to really move from a national piecemeal to a truly European approach – pooling resources, increasing interoperability, prioritising the security of European citizens over the benefits of those of the arms industry – we are here to support.

They fear for the lives of hostages, and they are seeking shelter from ongoing Hamas shelling. In Gaza, people are mourning their children, parents, spouses who have become victims of Israel’s shelling of civilian infrastructure. They fear for those who remain exposed to ongoing airstrikes and suffer under the siege of Gaza.
All human beings have the right to live in safety and freedom. Demanding this for one group does not question this right in relation to another group. Empathy is not a zero-sum game.
The announced release of hostages linked to a temporary truce offers a new glimpse of hope to end the spiral of violence. The European Union, together with the UN, Arab states and the US, must facilitate a process where both Israelis and Palestinians can work on solutions to live side by side in peace. Hopefully for good this time.

Wenn wir die Klimakrise stoppen wollen, dann müssen die Fossilen im Boden bleiben. Wir müssen also jetzt reden über den massiven Ausbau der Erneuerbaren und über Klimaschäden und faire Kompensation. Dafür brauchen wir die Zivilgesellschaft am Tisch. Tausende Menschen verlieren heute schon ihr Zuhause. Jeden zweiten Tag wird ein Mensch ermordet, der sich für mehr Klimaschutz einsetzt. Und in den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten sitzen immer noch Dutzende Menschenrechtsaktivisten in Haft, sogar nachdem sie ihre Strafen abgesessen haben.
Wir alle, die wir zu COP fahren, sollten die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate an ihre Versprechen gegenüber den zivilgesellschaftlichen Akteuren erinnern. Und auch daran, ihnen alle politischen Freiheiten zu gewähren. Und gleichzeitig: Ohne die Golfstaaten im Team Klimaschutz kriegen wir diese Welt nicht gerettet, egal wie viel wir Bahn fahren. Deswegen: Lasst uns diese COP nutzen, um die Golfstaaten zu Vorreitern bei echtem Klimaschutz zu machen.

You know it and we all know it: how widespread the abuse of spyware is. This Parliament has worked hard to develop recommendations on how to fix it that have been carried by a broad majority. Yet, so far nothing happened, although the Commission had promised to pick them up. In the meantime, we keep learning about new revelations. Members of Parliament targeted again, including President Metsola, European companies illegally circumventing export regulations and European stakeholders making money by sending spyware to dictators, who use them to target human rights defenders. Frankly said, it is only a matter of time before military-grade spyware ends up in the hands of terrorists. So what more do you need to finally act?
Commissioner, the European Union has one superpower. The superpower is to set standards and regulations that then become global ones. We have managed to regulate the use of ‘ABC’ – atomic, biological and chemical weapons – globally. The EU must now take the lead to also regulate the use of these digital weapons and ban its most intrusive forms. Frankly said, exploring options for a non-legislative proposal is not going to be good enough. So, I have only one question: when is the Commission putting forward a legislative proposal to fix this highly dangerous mess?

Employees of the old regime are under constant threat. Women are not even allowed to go to parks anymore and schools are turned into jihadi madrassas.
The situation seems devastating. The media spotlight has shifted, but our attention should not because there are things we can do. We can advocate for gender apartheid to be recognised as a crime under international law. We can make sure that human rights defenders under threat are given flexible visas so they can continue their important work in Afghanistan, yet leave the country when needed. We can ensure that all organisations running programmes for women by women receive adequate and unbureaucratic funding.
There is something very concrete all of you can do next week nominate Parasto Hakim, Marzia Amiri and Matiullah Wesa, three education rights activists, for the Sakharov Prize to ensure again that the spotlight is on Afghanistan and to ensure recognition and protection for the many resisting the Taliban.

It has been ten years of brutal repression since, with so many critical voices locked behind bars. Journalists, political activists, human rights defenders, one of them, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the prominent face of the Arab Spring, who has served about ten years in prison combined and has not seen his son for over two years now. Another one is publisher Hisham Kassem, who was imprisoned on charges of defamation shortly after he had helped to form a coalition of opposition parties. It is brutal violence and tens of thousands of political prisoners, this is how al-Sisi secures his power. Yet EU Member States continue lucrative arms deals with this regime. So far, no human rights sanctions have been imposed on high-ranking Egyptian officials. And even worse, right now, the European Commission is preparing a dirty deal with al-Sisi to prevent migration, while human rights defenders in Egypt remain blocked from leaving the country. This hypocrisy must end.

Yet all I heard was we are trying our best, but it’s complicated. But in the end, Mr Borrell, it’s not the intention that counts, it’s the results. And where are we as of today? The Iranian regime exchanges hostages with convicted terrorists and kidnaps new ones. It becomes more repressive by the day. It is only weeks away from the nuclear bomb. It destabilises a whole region by proxy wars. And Iranian drones are attacking our allies in Ukraine. 
Mr Borrell, it’s time to clearly spell it out. The EU’s Iran policy of the last 44 years has failed, and it is your job to think about new policies. Stop meeting regime representatives and start meeting the many different people that advocate for a free Iran, stop financial flows of the regime and start exploring avenues for the diaspora to send home remittances for the strike front. Encourage Member States to give more humanitarian visas to those badly injured by regime violence and spell out the truth. This regime terrorises its own citizens and the whole region. It systematically uses rape to force political prisoners into confessions, and it is already preparing to crack down the protests planned for 16 September. 
Mr Borrell, you have to stop stabilising a brutal regime while the people in Iran are prepared to die for its downfall. (The speaker used a slogan in a non-EU language)

We will vote in favour of EDIRPA because we hope that it is a small step ahead to supply Ukraine with the equipment it urgently needs and because it may lead to a little more cooperation in the defence sector. But, frankly said, it’s just a small patch on a big oozing wound for a fragmented and inefficient defence sector. 
To keep our citizens safe and to support our allies such as Ukraine, we need Member States to finally move from the current protectionism to a truly European defence with cooperation starting from raw materials over joint procurement to joint export control.
We also need to move from the current secretive deals in the Council to open debates on defence in the European Parliament. European defence needs European debate and it needs European scrutiny and this has to happen in this House. 
So, for four times now we have given away our rights of scrutiny with EDF, with EDIDP, with ASAP and with EDIRPA. The ECR, EPP and Renew gave away easily the delegated acts and I hope this will finally change next time in the interest of the security of our European citizens and that of our allies.

Nobel Peace Prize awardee Maria Ressa is, until today, blocked from leaving the Philippines without prior court permission because of pending SLAPP cases against her. And the only goal of such strategic yet baseless lawsuits is to intimidate, harass and silence critical voices.
Because once you are faced with a SLAPP case, you need to read that file. You need to hire a lawyer, you need to appear in court, you need to fight related smear campaigns, sometimes even your bank accounts are being frozen. In addition, such SLAPP cases overburden already strained judicial systems and undermine trust in legal proceedings.
Dear colleagues, this is simply a perversion of rule of law. It is about time that we stand up and stop it in the EU and all around the world. So thank you, Tiemo, for your report. It is a good first step and let’s join forces to walk down that road even further.

Tens of thousands of political prisoners are held on trumped-up charges in Iran because they advocate for freedom.
At least eight protesters are at imminent threat of execution for demanding freedom: Ebrahim Narouie, Kambiz Kharout, Shoeib Mir Baluchzehi Rigi, Manouchehr Mehman Navaz, Mohammad Ghobadlou, Mojahed Kourkour, Milad Zohrevand and Mansour Dahmardeh. And at least two EU citizens are being held hostage by the regime, and they are on death row because this regime fears freedom: Jamshid Sharmahd and Ahmad Reza Jalali.
And I request everyone who engages with this regime to start talks by saying these names, by demanding their release again and again. I will not be silenced.

If one of your best journalists is spied upon while investigating a major story, if one of your state prosecutors is spied upon while preparing court cases, if your defence minister is spied upon while attending NATO meetings, if one of your companies is exporting spyware to a war zone, if any of this happens and you are only a halfway-decent government with some responsibility, you would investigate. You would turn everything upside down, find the loopholes that make this possible, bring perpetrators to justice, apologise to victims, right?
I don’t get why none of this happens. So basically, we, the PEGA Inquiry Committee, did your job in the last 12 months. Yet rather than working with us, Member States’ governments ignored or obstructed our work, the approach was omertà, not cooperation. 
Looking at this mess, I am quite amazed by what we have achieved here. And I want to thank the rapporteur, the shadows, all Members for that, because we managed to come forward with an accurate description of the abuse that is happening and with very solid and reasonable recommendations on how to fix it, supported across party lines by Members, by colleagues from 27 EU Member States. 
And if you ever wondered what the European Parliament is good for, for this. Europe has been a pioneer in protecting the privacy of its citizens and has set standards that have become global ones by now. We bent the entire Internet ecosystem towards better protection and respect of individuals’ data rights. Yet on something as horribly destructive as spyware, it looks as if we are lagging behind. 
But dear colleagues, if we want to see European – and yes, universal – values reflected in the regulation of these invasive technologies, it is time to stand up to the shady practices of secret services and to companies and their CEOs gone wrong. Because otherwise the next chapter of surveillance and manipulation, then involving AI and other powerful technologies, will be very, very dark. 
We have done our job, Commissioner. Now it’s time that you do yours, the Commission and the Council. And believe me, we will follow up, and follow up, and follow up until our recommendations are put in place.

This regime is harassing, beating, torturing, raping, killing its own citizens, and, so far, it gets away with it. 
It gets away with it because a culture of impunity persists in Iran and a culture of silence is developing again in the international community. I mean, how can Ebrahim Raisi, who was instrumental in killing thousands of protesters in 1988, get away with it and now be, 30 years later, the president of Iran? How can we, as the international community, allow a regime that brutally terrorises its own citizens to chair the UN Human Rights Council Social Forum, when it would actually be our job to watch carefully what is happening in Iran, to condemn every single killing, to sanction the perpetrators, and to do our part to break the cycle of impunity? 
Because if we don’t, 300 executions may soon turn into 3000. This regime kills when it thinks it can get away with it, and we have to make sure it no longer does. Silence will only lead to more violence.

So it’s good that the Commission finally comes forward with the plan to ramp up the production of ammunition – a bit late maybe, but at least it is there now and it has indeed a considerable number of good components. 
We as Greens will support the urgency procedure, given that it is secure that the competent committees will be fully involved, including SEDE, and the proposal will be reduced to the most urgent measures that we need to debate with urgency. 
But what I don’t understand, Commissioner, is why you intend to throw millions of EU taxpayers’ money at the already very profitable defence sector; money that is desperately needed elsewhere for the green transformation of our own economy. Rheinmetall had a net income of EUR 535 million in 2022, the Tardis Group EUR 1.5 billion, Airbus EUR 4.2 billion – these companies really do not need taxpayers’ money and we shouldn’t throw it at them for nothing. 
So, frankly said, either the arms industry uses its own money to scale up ammunition production, given that it is now quite a solid business opportunity, or, if we decide to support them with EUR 500 million from EU funds and many more billions from the RRF and Cohesion Funds, we should at least make sure that EU taxpayers get their own share of the return on investment. 
And how can we secure that? Well, by coupling the regulation at hand with an excess profits tax for the defence industry. We give them money to ramp up ammunition production and they give us whatever in addition they earn with it. 
Dear colleagues, the war in Ukraine brings sorrow and death to so many Ukrainian families. We must stand by their side and we will. Yet what happens in Ukraine should not be misused as a money-making machine for an already highly profitable arms industry at the expense of EU taxpayers and the necessary economic transformation that we dearly need in other sectors.

Meines Wissens nach sagt aber der Gemeinsame Standpunkt der Europäischen Union, dass Rüstungsexporte auch in Kriegsgebiete, wenn sie dem Selbstverteidigungsrecht dienen, genehmigt werden dürfen. Genau das haben wir ja in der Ukraine, wo Russland einmarschiert und die Ukraine sich selber gegen diese Aggression verteidigt. Oder liegt dir eine andere Version des Gemeinsamen Standpunktes vor?

Only one and a half years after the Taliban took power, women are banned from public life – no education, no parks, no work. In their latest cynical decree, women are no longer allowed to work for the UN.
Today’s Taliban are willing to sacrifice the lives of more than one million Afghans threatened by starvation only for their gender apartheid ideology. They attack the future of their country, the education of its youngest. The Taliban’s self—proclaimed Minister of Education announced the preparation of a new jihadi – yes, that’s the word he used – curriculum. Private schools are being forced to close by now in at least two districts, and madrassas are being built across the country, providing the only means of education for many boys.
At the same time, those advocating for education in line with Afghan tradition in line with Islamic teaching, are put behind bars like Matiullah Wesa from Pen Path. He spent more than 14 years of his life travelling throughout Afghanistan, finding local solutions for local problems, working with tribal leaders to open schools in rural areas. This guy is an Afghan national hero.
Let’s face the terrible truth. The Taliban are holding women captive in their homes and they want to raise a new generation of jihadi fighters. I know there is no easy answer, no easy solution for this, but this is precisely why we can’t turn our backs. This is precisely why we have to watch carefully what is happening in the country, why we shouldn’t even think about recognising the Taliban, and why we should all jointly demand the release of Matiullah Wesa and all those unjustly held in Taliban prisons.

Here we are 20 years after the start of a US-led invasion that paved the way for war crimes, the torture and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners, and a brutal civil war. 
Here we are 10 years after the withdrawal of the US troops, which led to the rise of the Islamic State and unbelievable brutality. 
And more than 3 years after young Iraqis took to the streets with slogans like ‘We are all Iraqis’, while hundreds of them have been killed by Iraqi security forces and Iran-backed militias. 
And once more, impunity prevails. 
Yet, how is the country supposed to heal if such crimes go unpunished, when all these stories of suffering are never told or heard? 
So, since the protest movements emerged in autumn 2019, I have visited Iraq several times, listening to women activists in Baghdad, Yazidis families in Dohuk, musicians in Mosul, or human rights activists in Erbil, and many are indeed disappointed and angry that such a peaceful movement calling for reform was brutally crushed by the authorities. 
But the spirit of the movement lives on with young people striving for a new Iraq that overcomes religious and ethnic divisions and fights the notorious corruption, depriving a whole generation of its resources and future.
And the EU should put a much stronger emphasis on supporting these civil society actors, especially the young generation in Iraq, by supporting their training, giving them new opportunities to build a better homeland and to address the challenges the climate crisis poses on their country. 
Last year, I was involved in the organisation of the Mosul Music Festival that was partly funded by the EU and UNESCO in the city. Mosul is the former capital of ISIS, and there we saw women and men playing traditional Iraqi music together with bands from Europe. And there is maybe no better way to chase away the ghosts of terrorism, war and destruction than music, dance and exchange.

It is crucial that Member States now move forward with urgency and with ambition to make the capacity operational by 2025 – although 2024 would even be better – to establish it as a permanent multinational unit to finally provide enough funding and staff to the MPCC as promised many years ago, and adequate resources to the European Peace Facility to imburse all operative costs.
Those are important technical details, but let us take a step back. Why are we discussing the rapid deployment capacity today? The first reason: because its predecessor, the EU Battlegroups, have never been deployed since their creation 20 years ago. ‘Why?’ you may ask. Well, mainly because EU Member States never had the political will to deploy forces jointly under one European umbrella and an initiative report clearly will not change that. So I call on Member States to finally back up their words with actions.
And the second reason being the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, how it exposed the EU as an onlooker in a crisis, and how we had to leave our Afghan partners behind in catastrophic circumstances. So I call on this Parliament and the Council to show now equal determination to develop further tools to better protect our local partners and ever create them when needed. Those currently in hiding and living in constant fear of being killed in Afghanistan, as well as those worrying about their future in Mali today.
This, dear colleagues, is the other crucial part of our responsibility. And without the support of local partners, no EU action, no matter how rapidly deployed, will ever have a positive political impact on the ground.

They do not fight with weapons. They use the power of words, of compassion, of persistence. They are not the enemy of the state but a force of good. This is why 25 years ago, the United Nations adopted a groundbreaking declaration on human rights defenders recognising their important contribution to peace, to sustainable development and human rights, and requesting states to protect them and support them. The EU guidelines on the protection of human rights defenders are based on this declaration, and today we assess how EU institutions and Member States implement these guidelines.
Why is it important? Well, all around the world, human rights defenders are more and more under attack. They are threatened. They are persecuted. They are sometimes even murdered for doing things that we in here have the privilege to take for granted: to fight corruption, to protect local forests, or sometimes even to just dance in the streets. In 2020 alone, 358 human rights defenders were killed. Each and every one of them is a voice that has been silenced, a person that dared to stand up, that dared to believe that change is possible so much that they were willing to give their life for it.
‘You are the only ones who still care.’ That is what a woman’s rights defender told me about a year ago in Kabul, and by ‘you’, she meant the EU, and yes, she’s right. We still make human rights a priority. And at the same time, I was ashamed to hear this from her after we had failed so miserably in Afghanistan.
So how can we, the EU, better live up to our ambitions? And that here, my report, our report, has many concrete suggestions. Maybe the main one: if we, EU and Member States, act together, we can save lives and change structures. Yet often enough we just don’t do that. So more consistency from country strategy to regular coordination of actions would be a big step forward.
There is more, just a few short examples. We have to work on prevention and become more flexible in our funding. We need to extend our focus to the networks and family of defenders because often suppressive regimes often deliberately target the families to silence defenders. Visas could be a key tool of support, yet rarely we make use of it, so defenders need easier access to visas.
We have to speak more about the many different kinds in which you can defend human rights, about those who support women’s rights, about LGBTI activists, about environmental defenders, as well as those who protect the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. They all deserve our protection.
Finally, we should be more proud about the support we offer, about the great work our delegations do in the field, because often those who need our support are not aware of the guidelines or of tools such as ProtectDefenders, and this needs to change.
Dear colleagues, too often we shrug our shoulders when we hear about the challenges human rights defenders face, as if the risks they take simply come with the job. But that’s not true. People being harassed, imprisoned, even killed only for defending human rights is something we should never accept. This is the line we need to hold. I’m confident that this report can guide us, the European Union and Member States, to become better allies to our allies on the ground.

Thank you to the EEAS and the Commission, which supported with a lot of insights, to the delegations in Colombia and Afghanistan that facilitated fieldwork, to the special representative Eamon Gilmore, but also to Mary Lawlor and Michel Forst, who supported in the project, to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions, which protect defenders, to the many NGOs working on that, and to my shadow rapporteurs. This file is really a good example of what we can achieve if we work together across party lines. Thank you, Janina Ochojska, Raphaël Glucksmann, Katalin Cseh, Miguel Urbán Crespo and Assita Kanko. It was a very good experience and I think 25 years after the adoption of the UN resolution on the protection of human rights defenders is a good moment to review where we are, to improve our implementation, to bring a lot of political will behind it. And I count on all of you to make sure that the recommendations we make in this report will actually make it into a change of policy on the ground.
Then there is one last group of people I want to thank. I know no one more dedicated and courageous in fighting for justice and peaceful societies than human rights defenders. You all are crucial to making your communities, your countries, our world a better place. None of this is easy, so just from all of us, thank you for the work you do.

They are out in the streets waving their hijab. They are singing Baraye Azadi in the classrooms, they chase away militias and they even record videos dancing in the streets.
But while those dancing in the streets on Women’s Day have been put in prison for two days, forced into confessions and forced into wearing a hijab, those poisoning schoolgirls with gas are still running free. And while the regime puts all its resources behind harassing and jailing girls, they only issue lukewarm calls for investigations after months of poisoning. But believe me, no one is falling for this regime propaganda anymore, which is why we call for an international investigation into the poisoning and for more sanctions against all those terrorising the people of Iran.
Dear colleagues, no one will be able to silence the women of Iran and I want us to stand with the girls, the women, the people of Iran until they are all free. (The speaker used a slogan in a non-EU language)

The topic of the debate is indeed a transatlantic approach in a multilateral world. And one area where we can witness at least a multitude of actors at the moment is the Middle East. Over the weekend, China brokered a deal with Saudi and Iran, while we still have no special envoys, the EU. The US President declared the JCPOA as dead while you are still trying to negotiate it, some EU Member States and the US export arms to Saudi Arabia or the UAE, while others have embargoes in place, and many Gulf countries are trying to be friends with the EU, with the US and Russia at the same time. So I am wondering if there is still such a thing as a transatlantic alliance, or at least a transatlantic approach to the region, and if yes, what it looks like along these very concrete examples.

Are there any consultations between the EU and the US on how either the JCPOA or an alternative plan to deal with this is being pursued?

So let’s be very clear: this is a corruption scandal and it’s not an NGO scandal. 
So rather than attacking NGOs, not just in this debate today, and some of these NGOs are actually our biggest allies when it comes to fighting corruption, we should fix our own problems. As so often, if you point with one finger to the others, there are at least the pointing back to you. We need this ethics body that President von der Leyen promised three years ago. We need a culture in which whistleblowers feel safe enough to finally speak up. We need more resources for OLAF, and we need to apply the same rules for everybody, regardless of big names, regardless of good connection when it comes to access, for example, to this Parliament and this Parliament’s resources, because frankly said that was the biggest problem with Fight Impunity. 
The voters want us to clean up this corruption mess. They don’t want us to engage in cheap party politics nor in scapegoating, and this debate feels a bit like this.

The European Union is a key player when it comes to Iran, and our High Representative is the coordinator for the nuclear negotiations with Iran. So what we do here matters for the future of Iran and the Middle East, and the European Parliament has a role in that. Yet for three times now, the High Representative did not show up for the debate with this Parliament on the issue of Iran – despite the fact that he was in town. On 9 November he couldn’t be there so we rescheduled the debate for 22 November, when right when we started the debate he walked out of the plenary. 
So we had a unanimous message from the Conference of Presidents to him that he had better be here for the debate yesterday. Yet again yesterday, Mr Borrell was in Strasbourg, but he wasn’t here in the evening. Colleagues, we are talking about one afternoon a month where we ask him to adjust his schedule to our plenary debates. I have to say that I find it difficult not to interpret this behaviour as a sign of disrespect to Parliament, and also to the 12 000 people who were here on Monday. 
(Loud applause)
I understand very much that we cannot drag him here by physical force. So maybe this public statement will help. I encourage the Conference of Presidents to also define what else they can do to make him appear here next time. Otherwise, I promise you, I will make this point of order again!

And this regime is under pressure because people in Iran are even willing to die for a brighter future. And we, the European Union, should not be the one stabilising a regime while its own people fight for its downfall.
So how can our High Representative on the one side denounce executions and at the same time meet the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs on the red carpet in Amman? How can he speak about reviving the JCPOA if the only thing that comes out of it is the international reputation and recognition that the regime urgently needs?
So the time for this ambiguous policy is over. As long as the brutal crackdown on protests continues, we should not negotiate. As long as the Revolutionary Guards terrorise their own people and the whole region, we should treat them as terrorists and put them on the sanctions list. The Iranian people have taken to the streets in Iran and all over the world, and they ask for our support. I stand with them. And so should all of us.

So please allow me to also make a remark a bit out of the ordinary. I have to say that I am quite surprised by the fact that the EPP now decides not to table, not to negotiate and not to vote on urgency resolutions. The fact is that apparently, third countries, autocratic regimes, are trying to interfere with us. They are trying to influence with illegal means, with bribery and corruption, the way we work here.
I don’t think that our political answer to this should be to no longer criticise their human rights atrocities. So I really think we have to debate this in a proper way and not under the point of the Chinese Government crackdowns. We have also to honour the human rights defenders in China that we are supposed to be talking about here today.

In Bahrain, human rights defender Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja was sentenced to life in prison because he led pro-democracy protests and is still in prison today and our urgency resolution is about his case.
But his case is by far not the only one in the region: 34 years in prison for PhD scholar Salma al-Shehab in Saudi Arabia for her tweets on women’s rights. Life imprisonment for the Qatari lawyers Hazza and Rashed bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri, who had organised so—called unauthorised meetings. Ten years for human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor in the UAE for his social media activism. And lawmakers in Iran have just called on the judiciary to sentence protesters to death. For what? For calling for political freedoms and the freedom of expression, and two of them have already been executed.
So in every encounter with the Gulf region and beyond, we have to speak up on behalf of those who are not allowed to speak up. And we must call for the release of those unjustly detained again and again and again, and especially and continuously in this European Parliament. Because if we are silent, they will be forgotten in their dark prison holes, but theirs are the voices that the world needs to hear.

And that is the very foundation of our mandate, and it is so across party lines. And colleagues, until last Friday, I was pretty sure that the dissent that we have, the debates that are sometimes hard, but always the core of democratic decision-making were based on political opinions, on different political opinions and not on suitcases full of money. And this trust now is deeply shaken. We are all standing in the middle of a crime scene with offices sealed, colleagues in prison confronted with the allegation that at least one of us has become a Trojan horse of corruption and foreign interference. 
And I have no illusions. Autocratic regimes have tried to bribe us before, and they will continue to do so in the future, and that is why I want this inquiry committee of the Parliament to know more, to know better what has happened more, to better prevent it in the future, and yes, to build trust again. Our response to this scandal, dear colleagues, has to be clear to the inside as well as the outside. We are not for sale and nor is European democracy.

It’s always the same patterns: the regime shuts down the internet, it kills in darkness, and that is why it is our job to put the spotlight on what is happening in Iran.
There are even testimonies that the Revolutionary Guards picked the most beautiful protesters, boys and girls, and then raped them – so that others no longer dare to raise their voices. And colleagues, I want to know what happens, and I don’t want those responsible for these atrocities to get away with it.
This Thursday – the day after tomorrow – the UN Human Rights Council will hold its first ever special session on Iran and it will vote on the establishment of an independent fact-finding mission. Colleagues, this is a key vote. We have to document the atrocities. We have to fight impunity. And I want us to make sure that it’s the broadest possible majority coming out of this special session. 
And then there will be 12 December – it’s another Foreign Affairs Council. And the 227 Iranian members of parliament who asked for severe punishment are still not on the sanctions list. We have their names. We know their offence. And the colleagues pointed it out – how much more does this need to happen before we finally put the whole Revolutionary Guard on the sanctions list? 
And maybe someone can send this message to Mr Borrell because, once again, he’s not showing up in this debate. 
I understand well, there’s only so much we can do from the outside. But that is why it is needed that we fully dedicate ourselves to doing just so much. This is the least we owe to the brave protesters who stand up against that oppression in Iran every day. 
Colleagues, our attention and our determination are the best protection we can give to them, and that is what we should do with all the energy we have.

Even five years after the defeat of ISIS, Yazidi families still live there in confined places in an environment of unhealed trauma and limited possibilities. 
But that day I played soccer with the Scoring Girls, a team of girls that practice every afternoon, and the day I visited their fathers and brothers – even them – were watching their kids, their girls playing proudly. There was laughter, there were hugs, there was hope and the clear message that girls can do everything – even Yazidi girls in Iraq. 
That is the power of soccer, dear colleagues. And then there’s this FIFA show happening right now – money, bribes, migrant workers dying on construction sites and big bosses celebrating their toxic privileges. 
Yes, the laws for migrant workers in Qatar have improved – and we will follow up if implementation will happen once the spotlight moves on, believe me – but no one needs a championship where even messages as simple as ‘One Love’ are penalised with a yellow card. 
Dear colleagues, this is just a lost opportunity for soccer and for the sad world in which we live today.

So people in the streets, people in prisons are beaten up, are raped, are killed – not by criminals but by people who claim to be the government of this wonderful country. And, colleagues, this needs a very strong signal from the European Union that we don’t accept this, including targeted sanctions against exactly these 227 Members of Parliament. 
And we cannot have this debate some other time, colleagues, because the Council is right now preparing the sanctions package to be issued by the Foreign Affairs Council next Monday. And, as of now, this package has only 31 individuals. So we have to have this debate this week and not in two weeks or in a month. 
So now it was brought to our attention that apparently we cannot have this debate this week because neither the High Representative nor the Council would be able to be present. I mean, dear colleagues, imagine this in a national context! A parliament cannot have a crucial debate because the officials responsible are not showing up. 
We should not accept this and I really call on the Council or the HR / VP to make themselves available for this debate today or tomorrow.

This is exactly the question I asked Iranians on Twitter after 227 members of the Iranian Parliament asked for their execution. I got thousands of replies. I could use my real name on Twitter. I could walk in the streets without fear of being beaten up. I could finally go back home to my homeland, hug my old mother. Ukrainians wouldn’t be killed by our drones. A peaceful Middle East. 
14 000 Iranians who took to the streets for these demands are at the moment at imminent threat of execution. And the President of Iran is no stranger to that. He has killed in 1988. He has slaughtered thousands of political prisoners in Iran already. 
It is not on us to change the regime. But, colleagues, it is on us to be very clear that those who fight for political freedoms in the streets of Iran have our full solidarity and support. We need to sanction all 227 members of the parliament who made this outrageous call to execute political prisoners. And we need to designate the Revolutionary Guards as what they are – a terror organisation. 
We need to convene a special session of the UN Human Rights Council to set up a reporting and accountability mechanism. And dear colleagues, each and every one of us has to do everything possible to make sure that those dying at the moment in Iran every single day, for a different future, do not die for nothing.

Ich stand im Sommer bis hierhin im Wasser der Oder, um tote Fische einzusammeln. Das war eklig, und es war auch wahnsinnig traurig. Ich habe das zwei Stunden gemacht. Andere haben das zwei Wochen lang gemacht. Das macht niemand freiwillig. Und ich will erst mal sagen: Danke – dziękuję bardzo – für alle, die diese Arbeit getan haben. 
Was da passiert ist diesen Sommer, das war eine menschengemachte Katastrophe. Und das heißt, Menschen müssen jetzt auch was machen, dass das nicht noch mal passiert. Keine Schuldzuweisungen, sondern vor allem konkrete Schritte nach vorne.
Erstens, wir dürfen nicht mehr so viele Chemikalien in die Oder einleiten – auch jetzt, wo die Muscheln tot sind, die die Filteranlage des Flusses waren. Wir brauchen gemeinsames, transparentes Monitoring für den Zustand des Flusses und grenzüberschreitende Warnsysteme, damit wir mitkriegen, bevor was passiert, bevor es kippt, bevor die Fische wieder sterben. Und ja, genauso wie diesen Sommer ist die Oder jedes Jahr monatelang nicht beschiffbar. Und egal, wie tief jemand buddelt, aus der Oder wird kein Rhein. Deswegen muss das deutsch-polnische Regierungsabkommen wieder auf den Tisch, es muss neu verhandelt werden im Sinne der europäischen Wasserrahmenrichtlinie. Bis dieses Abkommen up to date ist, brauchen wir einen Baustopp, damit nicht noch mehr sinnlos zerstört wird entlang der Oder.
Ich weiß, Frau Kommissarin, viele Punkte waren auch auf Ihrem Zettel. Aber deswegen sollte die Kommission auch mal kritisch den Einsatz von EU-Fördermitteln an der Oder prüfen. Denn hier werden täglich Dinge gebaut, die dem Fluss schaden, statt ihn zu schützen – mit EU-Geld gegen EU-Regeln. 
Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, dieser Sommer hat uns eins gezeigt: Die Oder ist vor allem ein sehr, sehr verletzliches Ökosystem. Deswegen müssen wir uns jetzt einfach endlich gemeinsam und vernünftig um den Tisch setzen – Deutschland, Polen, Tschechien und die EU – und überlegen, wie es weitergehen soll, im Sinne des Flusses und vor allem im Sinne der Menschen, die dort leben und arbeiten.

And so far we've failed on all levels. 
What's with the regulatory frameworks put in place to make attacks on journalists from members of parliament impossible? Well, apparently they collapse, at least in Hungary, Poland, Spain and Greece. The parliamentarian judicial control mechanisms, they are not working. And until today it's civil society and journalists that expose these scandals and not us. And the victims are left alone with often the only option to complain to the very same institutions that illegally spied on them in the first place. 
So you would think the governments responsible of this would like to become clean and fix it? Well, so far, they refused to cooperate with us in the committee, they cover on national level, they hide behind security interests, as if the protection of national citizens from illegal spying is not a security interest. 
So, in short, the use of spyware is out of control inside the European Union, and there can only be one consequence. We need a moratorium on the sale and the use of spyware until these problems are fixed.

We have seen at least one Commissioner and his staff members being spied on. We have seen five members of the European Parliament of this House being infected. This is an attack on EU institutions and it’s an attack on our parliamentary immunity. 
Mr Commissioner, if you say it’s Member States in charge, would you mind telling me which Member State is actually in charge of investigating this and protecting us from these attacks? I have to admit that I was expecting quite some outcry about what happened. But what do we have?
The Commission is here with neither the Commissioner attacked nor the Commissioner in charge. The Council? They don’t even bother showing up. And, here in the Parliament, it was only the Greens and GUE who requested this debate. 
Maybe this is because nearly all political groups have their own skeletons in the cupboard, with revelations coming in from Hungary, Poland, Spain and Greece. But, dear colleagues, these days we are at a crossroads. Either we remain silent and we continue ‘business as usual’ because everyone somehow has their problems and we just accept that, from now on, everyone, even in Europe, will be spied on, or we finally, and collectively, acknowledge that things are spiralling out of control – and Spain is just the best example to show this – and we start exposing this and stop it.
I really want us to go down this second road because, just imagine for one minute, that it were your worst political enemy at the disposal and in the possession of these tools, spying on lawyers, on journalists, maybe even on you. Zemmour in France, AfD in Germany, Vox in Spain – this list can continue for quite a bit. Would that not provoke the kind of outcry that at least I have been waiting for for the last two or three weeks?
I don’t think we should wait for this to happen, but take a very principled stand, altogether across political groups, Commission and Council. Now.

Girls are not going to school, activists are in hiding and families remain torn apart. Everyone has the responsibility to change that, especially the Taliban leadership; so this goes to you.
In August, in your famous press conference, you promised to respect women’s rights and media freedom; but now, for 200 days, girls have been banned from going to school. This is self-sabotage on a national scale, and we all know that many of your daughters are actually going to schools and universities abroad. So why shouldn’t all Afghan girls have the same rights as your daughters? Why don’t you just allow them to go to school?
And then, dear colleagues, it is also about our own responsibility. What happened to our promise to protect human rights defenders, activists and journalists? If this Union can set up a clearing house and raise EUR 1 billion to send weapons to Ukraine – and don’t get me wrong, I am all for that – why can’t we do the same to evacuate those at high risk from Afghanistan? Why do we put the burden on the most vulnerable? Why do we force NGOs to run from Member State to Member State with lists, begging for attention, dealing with opaque processes with little to no success? 
Civil disobedience on the ground in Afghanistan is growing. The diaspora is getting organised. It is not too late for us to step up, to organise coordinated evacuation for those who need to leave, and to put in place a fund to support those who decide to stay. We all have a responsibility to Afghan women and girls, and there is no withdrawal from that.

Well today we know this man is peak toxic masculinity. And what we see in Ukraine is the suffering that comes with a foreign policy that focuses on domination and aggression.
What hides behind the term feminist foreign policy, on the other side, is the foundation for a badly needed different approach to foreign policy: one where the security of humans is more important than that of nations or empires; one where the diversity of perspectives is seen as an asset and not as a threat by those in power.
So while we fight Putin’s aggressions, while we define sanctions, while we increase military spending, let’s not lose sight of the kind of change to change the kind of foreign policy that got us in this mess in the first place. If you want peace, we will need to get rid of the patriarchal structures dominating today’s foreign policy, also in our own institutions. The Gender Action Plan III is an ambitious tool in the right direction: let’s implement it with full force, exactly because of the crisis we are seeing today.

Like many of you, I spoke back then and for some reason my video was dragged all over Filipino news. Troll armies were sent out against me, I had 35 000 hate comments on my Facebook page and I have to admit I was glad I could just close my laptop and turn all of this off. I was glad I was not in the Philippines and it was just cyberattacks.
That’s a privilege our activist and politician colleagues in the Philippines do not have. My friend, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Maria Ressa, faces dozens of lawsuits, so—called SLAPP cases made up just to intimidate her. And only yesterday she was once more denied to travel outside of the country. My training partner in the Parliamentarian solidarity programme of this Parliament, Sarah Elago, is being attacked. It means the government initiates campaigns against her to brand her as communist, as terrorist, even her minor siblings are drawn into it, with their pictures all over fake news sites. And we know that these kind of attacks lead to also attacks in real life and sometimes even murder.
The Philippines, the country that was once known for the most vibrant civil society in Asia, has seen more than 220 killed human rights defenders in the last six years. Maria Ressa often says democracy dies by a thousand cuts. Frankly said, this country has seen more than one thousand cuts.
In May, there will be presidential and parliamentary elections. They could bring about change if only the process behind it were free and fair. The EU has offered to send an election observation mission. I want to thank EAS for that. But the Philippine government has bluntly ignored this request. It’s important now that the EU delegation, but also the embassies of all Member States, do everything they can to support local election observations and raise problems that they observe with the Philippine authorities.
And it is important, and all my colleagues have underlined that, that we send a clear signal to any new government. If the human rights situation in the Philippines does not improve significantly, the country’s special privileges under the GSP+ scheme will be revoked. We have a very broad majority in the Parliament behind this. Last time, dear Commissioner, you ignored it. We will not let this happen again.

Eighty per cent of the people displaced by climate change are women. Only 10% of the aid provided for local solutions goes to women, and only 0.2% of the funding goes to women—led organisations. While women are most affected by climate change, they receive the least support. And even though women prioritise climate action higher than men, they still do not sit at the key decision—making tables. In recent COPs women only received one quarter of the speaking time in plenary, and amongst the chief negotiators, women are largely absent, packed off into informal track-two workshops. 
So when it comes to climate change or climate action, we are doing the same old mistakes on resources and representation. I hope the upcoming UN Commission on the Status of Women is the moment to change that, because it needs to change profoundly.

They may not fight with weapons, they use the power of the word, they need a lot of persistence, but they are the only key we have to a sustainable change on the ground. And last year was clearly not a good year for them. The use of Pegasus and other spyware shakes the foundations of how they do their work and their networks. Afghanistan is just the most dramatic case of a global backlash on women’s rights and on political freedoms and many of us have lost friends and colleagues who were killed only because they protect and defend human rights.
And we tend to move on, as if that’s a risk that comes with the job. It’s not. Being harassed, being kidnapped, being tortured, being killed because of doing human rights work is something we should never accept, and that’s the line we need to hold. So, in the year to come, I hope we manage to move up the protection of human rights defenders on our political priorities and we ourselves will be better allies to our allies on the ground.

Like her, so many activists and journalists fight to protect civil liberties in Hong Kong, but more and more of them end up in jail, they are being beaten up with no due process inside.
So dear colleagues, what we have here – the freedom to raise our voice freely – is quite a privilege. I truly believe that this privilege comes with a responsibility: to use this voice to support and protect those who fight for democracy and freedom.
Well, it’s not as easy as it is here. We need flexible visa schemes for these activists; we need to increase our pressure on China. But there’s one concrete thing we all need to do: as long as our democratic allies are in prison in Hong Kong, as long as Uyghurs keep disappearing in Xinjiang, and as long as people can’t even light candles in China, none of us should participate in a political show in which the Olympic flame is misused to cover up grave human rights abuses.
Dear colleagues, I can’t go to China anyway, because I’m under sanctions. Others are as well. But it needs more; it needs a very clear political message: a joint European political boycott of these 2022 Olympic Winter Games, and, Mr Commissioner, we have two more weeks to work on that one.

One. Welcome to the club! Women have grown up policing their own behaviour for centuries – can I sit like this? Is my skirt too short? So what may feel like discrimination to you is actually just losing some privilege. Two. Sexual harassment, even if done unintentionally, is an abuse of power, so the powerful that we clearly are, we have to ask ourselves the question: do we want to use the power to intimidate and degrade, or to encourage and uplift those who do not have the privilege that we do? And three, as with all things in life, non-offensive behaviour can be learned. This is why this House offers anti-harassment training courses. This is why we should all do them mandatorily, including us as MEPs. I hope this was of some help.

Hannah NEUMANN,2021-11-25,EN,"Human rights violations by private military and security companies, particularly the Wagner Group",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-25-INT-4-097-0000_EN.html,"  Hannah Neumann (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, if private military and security companies behave like warlords, it’s time we treated them like warlords. The original job of these companies is actually to protect people and buildings, but what some do is smuggle arms, rape, torture, kill and do the dirty jobs for other governments. In return, they are allowed to use and to loot countries’ natural resources. The Wagner Group is present in this kind of business in half of Africa, rapidly expanding; new companies are mushrooming, and even private military and security companies (PMSCs) employed by Western governments have been involved in these kinds of crimes.
So it’s time that we got this under control. We have to sanction – and very thoroughly sanction – these PMSCs, but also those who contract them, for being involved in these kinds of human rights abuses. We should no longer support governments that rely on the services of PMSCs that commit human rights violations. Finally, we need to work on a very solid international framework that focuses on the accountability of these organisations and clearly restricts the legal tasks in which they are allowed to be involved.

This sounds like a rich and fulfilled life. But Ahmed Mansoor is also a prisoner. He’s serving a 10 year prison sentence because he was running an opposition blog, calling for human rights and political reform. And he’s by far not the only one in the United Arab Emirates who is behind bars because of his peaceful political engagement.
And it is by far not the first time that we are discussing this issue here in Parliament, that we call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those peaceful activists. But despite the many years of international calls for their release, the United Arab Emirates leadership has not moved an inch. 
Even worse, since the arrest, the second arrest, of Ahmed Mansoor in March 2017, he has been in solitary confinement. His wife has only been allowed to visit him a few times. This is unacceptable.
In early October, I will nevertheless be going to Dubai to visit the Expo. I will be speaking for the European Parliament. I will be discussing the EU Green Deal, and how we can work together to stop the climate crisis. And as much as such an engagement and cooperation on the side of climate is necessary, we cannot and should never remain silent on the human rights issues. This is why, with the same visit, I have put in a request to visit Ahmed Mansoor and other political detainees in the UAE prisons. 
As much as the Expo 2020 is an opportunity for the government, the leadership of the United Arab Emirates, to present itself as an international host and actor, it should extend the same courtesy and hospitality to its own citizens, including those that dare to be critical.

I take it everywhere, apparently. I do 1 000 things with it, to a degree that sometimes my husband is even jealous about the intimate relationship the two of us are having. But now imagine your biggest enemy sits in this phone. The person now wants to know everything about your contacts, the person now wants to see you dead, and there’s nothing you can do about it because you don’t even know it. And that is what Pegasus is about. It’s about deliberately targeting human rights defenders. It’s about deliberately targeting EU citizens. It’s maybe about deliberately targeting one of us because of the human rights work we do. 
This is a whole industry gone rogue, in a deadly alliance with the worst dictators of this world, making human rights work impossible. The Commissioner had many nice words and strategies. First of all, it’s about enforcement. Second, Commissioner, this whole thing has a foreign policy and human rights dimension you haven’t even spoken about. We need a global ban on the export of these kinds of spyware and we need to ask tough questions of other governments, including those in Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Two weeks ago, it was our ministers of home affairs who met and they didn’t pledge a single, a single resettlement place because they were afraid of bad opinion polls back home. 
Bad opinion polls, while the women are marching in the streets of Afghanistan, although they know they will be beaten up by Taliban. While our local partners are stuck in refugee camps in Pakistan, although we promised them safe passage. What we are doing right now is betraying the foundations on which our foreign policy is based: the trust of our local partners and our commitment to human rights. 
But there is a chance to get things right. Commissioner Johansson announced another resettlement conference and we need pledges in the tens of thousands. So every one of you who spoke about the protection of human rights and of activists today: as you walk out this room, pick up your phones, call your colleagues in the governments and make sure there will be substantial pledges. This one, it’s not about political power games and party politics. This one, it’s about responsibility.

They have made progress on women’s rights and announced substantial legal reforms. That’s good news. But we also know that blatant human rights violations are still a reality. It’s a reality for most in prisons that their situation is very, very bleak and we describe it all in our resolution. 
But again, Saudi Arabia is a key regional player. We need to engage with Saudi Arabia, be it to improve security in the Middle East or to fight the climate crisis. Saudi Arabia made it quite clear they want to engage with us and we need and should engage with Saudi Arabia. But all of our actions need to be guided by three questions. 
How can we strengthen and support all those who want to change Saudi Arabia towards more human rights, more rule of law and eventually democracy? How can we contain and ostracise those responsible for human rights violations? And how can we make sure that European companies do not enable, or even worse, profit from the suffering of human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia? 
This is how we can have an impact as parliamentarians, as diplomats, as Team Europe, but often enough we are not using it. For many years, European companies have exported surveillance technology to Saudi Arabia that is used to track dissidents. Some Member States are still exporting arms to Saudi Arabia, despite the violations of humanitarian law that are committed with these weapons in Yemen. There are still no sanctions on those responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and political delegations shake hands and sign business deals without a word of support for those in prison. 
It is important to engage with Saudi Arabia and it is important to also name perpetrators, denounce oppressive structures and show solidarity with victims. We can do both. We should do both. And Charles Michel, I wish you a safe and successful trip to Saudi Arabia.

And you may have realised, especially with regards to China, it has created some effect and some impact. So I think it’s good that we finally debated it here in the European Parliament because it was actually the Parliament that initiated this mechanism. 
It is the Parliament that was mainly targeted by Chinese retaliation. And it’s the Parliament that we use to debate issues on human rights and EU foreign policy. So, Mr Logar, it may be the prerogative of the Council to decide on sanctions alone, but this is not how it should be. And this is part of our questions and our resolution as well, because at the moment we have an EU global human rights sanction regime where the European Parliament doesn’t have a say in it. 
So I think it’s good that, as a start, we agreed across all political parties that it’s time to establish a dedicated working group looking at the implementation of sanction regimes and making proposals for possible persons or organisations to be sanctioned. 
And I also call on the Council and Commission to reach out more strongly to civil society organisations, to journalists, to human rights defenders. They are our allies in the fight against human rights violations and I think they should also have a formal mechanism in which they can include their proposals, their ideas, their discussions into this mechanism, and not just random consultation whenever it pleases the Council and the Commission. 
That’s the second call. I think that is very important in our resolution. 
So after seven months of this mechanism, I think it’s good that we say congratulations, we have it and it has an impact. But I think now it’s time to join forces to make the best use of it. We here in the Parliament are ready. Civil society is ready and I have high trust in the Commission and the Council that they are equally willing to join forces with us to make the best use of this instrument.

I know this sounds obvious, but there’s still a long way to go. I just have one example. An oil company in Ecuador needed to get rid of toxic wastewater from its drilling activities and they simply spilled it into rivers for decades. The people living in the region got seriously ill. Steven Donziger, a human rights lawyer, represented them in court. They won the court case in 2011 and you would think everything is good. Well, today, just 10 years later, Stephen Donziger has been under house arrest in the US for 600 days now because Chevron, the oil company, staged a revenge trial against him. The people in Ecuador are still suffering from the disease and Chevron didn’t even pay a single US dollar of the 10 billion fine that they were sentenced to in court.
And these are exactly the vicious circles that we need to break if we want to make climate protection and accountability a reality. In this report we clearly say what more the EU can do because an ambitious Green Deal is not going to be enough. We also need to protect the right to a safe and healthy environment globally and we need to support all those who defend it.

But apparently capitals decided to waste EUR 8 billion from our EU budget for subsidies for the arms industry, and my colleagues from the ECR, EPP and Renew groups are apparently just too happy to support that. 
The least we can do now is to make sure that the weapons that will be developed with this money do not end up in the hands of dictators. That, actually, is also your job, Mr Breton, because according to not much heard of Article 22(4) of the European Defence Fund regulation, the Commission has the right to object to the export of EDF research results to a third country, as no such export should contravene the security interests of the Union and its Member States. Or, in less technical terms, the Commission has a say in arms exports resulting from EDF-funded projects. That’s why it’s time that we set up an EU-level arms export control system the very same day we spend the first euro from EDF-funded money, because we have seen far too often in the past how national mechanisms of export control fail in cases of multinational armament projects.

The European Union has sanctioned four Chinese human rights abusers. The Chinese have retaliated with sanctions on individual members of different parliaments – the whole Subcommittee on Human Rights, 27 Ambassadors and quite a number of think—tankers. This is a regime arbitrarily shooting a shotgun, targeting our freedom of expression, our freedom of research and our rights as Members of Parliament. 
So I think it is important, as a consequence, that we also are very clear in our response as the European Parliament as a whole. As members of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, we can no longer travel to China. We can also not invite experts on China to our committee because they would equally face sanctions, and we cannot rely on the work of think—tankers because they are banned from going to China. 
So, when it comes to the EU—China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) that China wants us to ratify, we may be able to discuss the economic dimension at length, but we are kept by China from discussing its effects on human rights. 
I am not willing to let a foreign country dictate to me how to do my job as a Member of Parliament, and I don’t think any one of us should accept that. I’m not sure if we are clear on that across the board. 
So, as long as any one of us is under sanctions, I think this Parliament should refuse to even start discussing the CAI, let alone ratify it, because our commitment to human rights, and our solidarity with the Uyghurs and the democratic movement in Hong Kong has to be more important than any potential economic effort or any potential economic benefit market access could have.

But sadly, Bahrain left this coalition and so far, six people have been executed and dozens are on death row, like Mohamed Ramadan and Hussein Ali Moosa. They report, both of them, that they were tortured into confessions, and both of them are at imminent risk of execution.
This is a very dramatic situation and it is a clear violation of international human rights standards.
Dear colleagues, as the Chair of the Delegation to the Arabian Peninsula, I really don’t want the rulers of Bahrain to go down that road. I would actually rather like to see them living up to the statements that they make, describing Bahrain as a country that is ‘soon to be a champion of human rights’.
And that is why I reiterate our call, that we have made in this Parliament repeatedly, to the Bahraini authorities: halt all executions and go back to the moratorium of the death penalty.

The recent mass trials against opposition and civil society are just the last step on a very dangerous path towards dictatorship.
In Cambodia, we are now looking at intimidation of environmental activists and restrictions of internet access, governmental censorship, violence against peaceful demonstrators and so much more. This is how the government undermines democracy and builds a breeding ground for fear and mistrust, and none of this is actually helpful to fight a pandemic. 
So, it is very much time that the Foreign Affairs Council sends a very clear signal to the leaders of Cambodia. Either they end all forms of harassment, repeal the long list of restrictive laws, and drop all charges against opposition, or they will have to face the consequences, including – and that is very important – targeted sanctions against Cambodian leaders and their egoistic economic interests.

Mr Borrell, I really don’t think that’s enough. So, while listening to you and my colleagues, I drew up a list of things that we can actually do now. The first one is to finally use the political leverage that comes with all the money that we have spent. For that, we need a strategy. Our strategy comes from 2017, so maybe we should revise that. Then, continue the fight against impunity by supporting all the universal jurisdiction processes that are happening in the European Union, and make sure there are more of them. Repatriate European citizens from Al-Hol and Roj camp. Ease family reunification and resettlement. And, finally, please treat those in camps inside Europe with dignity. Support peaceful and democratic activists in exile, and ease the visa and protection mechanism for everyone who needs to get out. 
Mr Borrell, dear colleagues, that is the least we owe to the people who have stood up against Assad’s regime for the last ten years.

Twenty—five years ago, the Beijing Declaration imagined a world in which women and girls could enjoy equal rights and enjoy fully human rights in all fields of life. 
But isn’t it strange that something as natural as this sounds like utopia today. Just one example: we may have doubled the number of women in Parliament in the last 25 years, but 90% of heads of governments are still men, and many of these 90% actually behave as if women fighting for parity were a threat to security. 
Well, if you are used to male privilege for centuries, equality may feel like discrimination. But let me tell you something, guys – it’s not. It is just women asking for their fair share and, believe me, we will continue to do so and we may even be a bit more vocal and a bit more assertive in the next 25 years. So you may do better just to join us in that fight!

But it’s also part of the story that this war is fought with weapons made in the European Union. The Eurofighter from Airbus is used to bomb hospitals in Yemen. French Mirage bombers are used by the United Arab Emirates to do exactly the same. Both airplanes are equipped with MK-80 bombs manufactured by RWM, the Italian subsidiary of German Rheinmetall. And the French company DCI is at this moment training Saudi soldiers on how to better launch rockets into Yemen. 
So we actually can do something as the European Union to stop this war. That’s why I think the message from our Parliament’s resolution needs to be crystal clear: no more weapons, no more spare parts, no more maintenance until the war in Yemen is over. And I want to say to Mr Borrell that I really hope that the message from the next Foreign Affairs Council will be just the same, because this is the only way we can build credibility, to put pressure on Iran and everyone else who wants to make money or politics with the suffering of the people in Yemen, to get out of this beautiful country and let the people of Yemen sort out their conflicts. 
And there’s actually a window of opportunity, and Mr Borrell, you mentioned that. The new US Administration is doing exactly this. They are working on a suspension of all arms deals to Saudi Arabia and the UAE and a diplomatic initiative, a new diplomatic initiative, to end the war in Yemen. I think that all of us in this room and beyond should do everything possible to make sure that the European Union picks up on this initiative, and to build a transatlantic alliance to stop the war in Yemen and the suffering of the people of Yemen.

How can the EU put pressure on Egypt for its human rights record, also against Giulio Regeni, when Italy sends more weapons than ever to el-Sisi? And how can the Council sanction Turkish officials for the escalation in the Mediterranean when Germany continues to send submarines to Erdoğan that may be turned against Greece?
Member States undermining European efforts by egoistic national deals and policies: that’s our biggest problem and that’s what needs to stop. So, from now on, I really want to see every Head of State who uses the term ‘strategic autonomy’ to clearly outline in which areas they are actually willing to delegate national sovereignty to European level; what they are doing to strengthen European capabilities to act; and what role they see for the European Parliament in all of this. Because what we need is the ability of the European Union to protect peace and human rights – at best with its partners, independently where necessary. But what we don’t need is another round of fuzzy concepts and inconsistent action by Member States.

In Egypt that is today run by a dictator – Mr Berg – a dictator that brands human rights’ defenders as terrorists, who puts people in jail for years for having not more than Whatsapp on their phones. And this dictator was received by President Emmanuel Macron last week who then officially announced that he will continue to supply this dictator with arms irrespective of his human rights record. 
Dear colleagues, that is carte blanche for Macron to do even worse and it is a slap in the face of each and every one who has been fighting for freedom and democracy in the Middle East for the last 10 years, because we all know the arms of France, the arms of Germany and of so many other countries, have been used against the protesters. I don’t want us to go down this road. That is why we need a real arms embargo. We need to suspend any budget support to this regime, and we need to see all the political prisoners freed.

Hannah NEUMANN,2020-12-17,EN,"Iran, in particular the case of 2012 Sakharov Prize laureate Nasrin Sotoudeh",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-12-17-INT-4-122-0000_EN.html,"  Hannah Neumann,  author. – Madam President, Nasrin Sotoudeh is a human rights lawyer. This means that she uses the laws of her country, Iran, to defend her clients, the people of Iran, against a regime that does not feel bound by any of these laws. The more Nasrin uses these laws, the more absurd become the charges of that regime. The latest one: 33 years and 148 lashes for defending women that took off their hijabs. 
Nasrin has now been 10 years in and out of prison in one of the countries with the cruellest prison conditions, amidst the raging COVID pandemic. Nasrin Sotoudeh really pays a high price for her love of the law and of the people of Iran. I’m full of admiration for this unbreakable woman and I think she rightfully deserved the Sakharov Prize from this Parliament. 
As you all know, Nasrin is not the only one. The regime’s repression got a lot crueller recently, with arrests and executions. Ruhollah Zam was executed last week, while Ahmadreza Djalali is threatened with execution, and no justice has been done for the thousands of protesters in the streets of Iran last year. 
That is why I think it’s so important that we send two clear signals today. One signal to the regime that if they continue like this they will be even more isolated and subject to targeted sanctions. And one signal to the brave Iranians, the vibrant and diverse civil society. You have our full solidarity, our full attention, our full support, as long as this is needed. Because, just like Nasrin, I hope that one day all the prisons of Iran will be turned into museums and parks.

In national parliaments across the EU, gender equality would take an average of 60 – six zero – years if you continue at the current speed. I will be dead by then, my children will be retired and we would have lost another two generations, and that is why we really need to get things moving. But Member States, and even those praising themselves for being very progressive, block major steps ahead, and yes, the German Government is part of this, with the Gender Balance on Boards Directive, for example. And that’s why it’s time for us to have this Council configuration, to ensure that we finally get gender mainstreaming across all sectors in all EU Member States. Dear colleagues, gender equality is not the cherry on top of the cake. It’s the cake.

Yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu – though not officially confirmed – visited Saudi Arabia. In a region that has been suffering from conflict and confrontation for decades, such a dialogue between former antagonists is a good sign, and yes, this region really needs such good signs. 
Therefore, one could actually wholeheartedly welcome the Abraham Accords if – and that’s the thing – they would live up to their stated goal to build peace. But – and that is also true, Mr White – recent developments are worrisome. The UAE has advanced a major arms deal with the USA as part of the bargain, as if we needed more weapons in the Middle East. Israel has stepped up its settlement policy against Palestinians and the human rights violations in Bahrain continue rather unnoticed.
So a deal that only serves to build alliances against other neighbours or to arm the region even further is neither going to build peace, nor should it be supported by the European Union. But, on the other hand, every step that the UAE, Israel, Bahrain and hopefully many, many others take towards de-escalation and peace should have our full support. 
So, very much in line with what you said, Mr Borrell, I think it’s time for a reality check. Let’s take the signatories at their word and use the new regional dynamic and the change in the US administration to initiate a new EU-led initiative to work towards an inclusive Israeli and Palestinian peace deal.

They shed light on situations that others want to keep in the dark. So a climate of impunity for crimes against journalism is as if we switch that light off and wander in darkness.
But it doesn’t always need a murder to silence a journalist’s voice. Authoritarian, and sadly even some democratic, regimes and governments have found other ways to muzzle media freedom. They are silencing journalists by anti-terror laws in the Philippines, by state interference in corona coverage in Tajikistan, or by the denial of permits and the withdrawal of accreditations, as in Belarus. These crimes may not be as obvious as killings, but the effects are very much the same: killing the freedom of the press, depriving people of their right to information and silencing critical voice after critical voice.
That is why I want our EU institutions and each and every one of our Member States to make sure that there is no impunity and no way for these governments to get away with these laws and restrictions. Commissioner, support is good, but I also want to see severe consequences if support is not changing anything. I want to see that within Europe and in each and every corner of this world.

Hannah NEUMANN,2020-10-22,EN,Gender Equality in EU’s foreign and security policy (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-10-22-INT-4-018-0000_EN.html,"  Hannah Neumann,  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, when Operation Sophia, the one that was actually still allowed to do search and rescue in the Mediterranean, was launched in 2015, there were long discussions about the operation plans because it was different, a new mission. Most of the discussion was about what kind of weapons this mission would need to overpower people on the boats and what kind of specific training to do that. At some point, it was a woman who asked about sanitary napkins and diapers because there would be women and small children on the boats and they would be on the ships with us for quite some days. In the end, the sanitary napkins and the diapers were used much more than the weapons.
This example just shows how more diversity leads to better decisions and, yes, sometimes it is that stereotypical. The same is true when we speak about peace negotiations because peace deals last longer if women are involved, because societies are more peaceful if they are gender equal, but still to this day negotiation tables and the whole field of peace and security is a male domain. I can’t even remember how many rooms I walked into in the last 15 years where I was the only woman, either being ignored or stared at curiously. 
That’s why we dedicated large parts of this report to our own EU institutions and our own EU budget because there we actually have 100% of the power to change it and no excuses. That’s why we ask for 50% of women in CSDP missions in our own services. That’s why we want a specific part of the foreign budget to go into projects that empower women and girls to claim their spot because they know how it works.
There was an amazing spirit during our negotiations in the committee because I think we all agree that we want an EU foreign policy that is for everybody. But now it’s time to change the reality out there and to really speed things up on women, peace and security. That’s why, Ms Urpilainen, but also Mr Borrell and the whole Commission, you had better come up with an ambitious gender action plan towards the end of this year.

While all of this is true and very frustrating, there is also hope in Iran.
There were massive protests of young people last year in the streets, taking their claims to the streets. Just a few weeks ago, women of Iran have started a ‘Me Too’ movement. There is even a ‘Fight for the Future’ group in the country. Young people in Iran are not living on a different planet. They are part of global movements, and they challenge the regime. Yes, they have to face crackdowns, oppression, repression, torture. They are in prison, some of them are executed. But they are coming back again, and again, and again. And the old ones who have gone through this for decades and decades have not stopped.
As long as people in Iran still have the courage to face this regime, it is our duty to support their cause and protect them. And while it is so important that the EU engages in regional dynamics, as Reinhard Bütikofer said, we can only do so if we also manage to engage the people that suffer under the various regimes in the region.

She had just lost a made-up case, and I was so worried about the human rights situation in the Philippines. 
I said Maria, what can we do as the international community? She said ‘democracy dies in darkness so you should is shed light on the situation’. That is exactly why we are having this debate today and that’s why I’m happy to see you here Ms Urpilainen.
But someone is missing, and that’s our new trade commissioner Mr Dombrovskis, because as the European Union we don’t have that many tools to protect human rights and democracy, and maybe our trade policy is the strongest one.
But Duterte, the president of the Philippines, who is encouraging his own services to kill tens of thousands of people, still enjoys EU trade privileges the under the GSP Plus scheme that are supposedly linked to improvements in human rights. 
The situation is just getting worse, and that’s why I’m so happy that across all political parties in this resolution we call on the Commission to start the procedure to revoke these privileges immediately and – to be frank – by immediately, we mean by Monday.

And that is why it’s so important that once a year we discuss EU arms exports in this Parliament, and that’s also why it’s so important that we use this report to improve our way to control where arms end up in this world. And that’s why I decided to use my report to focus on two things: on transparency and on convergence. In our report we all together reached quite a lot. For example, we are calling on the European External Action Service to actually translate these 500 pages of numbers and columns into an online-searchable database so that public oversight is actually possible.
We also ask the European External Action Service to build up a joint EU-level end-user control, rather than forcing 27 Member States to do like a semi-functional system, and we have a number of other suggestions on which we reached broad consensus in our negotiations. And I think we can be very proud, because they help us to better scrutinise and regulate EU arms exports. But as proud as we all can be, this doesn’t solve the main problem, and the main problem is that we have one common position on arms export of the EU, but we have 27 national interpretations, 27 export systems, and an increasing divergence in actual exports of Member States. And the more we work together in arms production, the more this will be a problem ˗ the more this will be a problem for democratic control and oversight, because if Member States produce arms together, who actually decides over the exports? Is it the Member State that puts in the most parts? Is it the Member State that puts in the last screw? Can one block all? Do you need to vouch your rights for democratic control before you can join? This is not very clear. And the conflict between France and Germany last year over arms exports to Saudi Arabia clearly showed how easily this can create tensions.
But this divergence is also a problem for a common EU foreign and security policy. We were also happy about the good results of the Berlin Conference earlier this year. We even set up an EU mission in the Mediterranean to enforce the arms embargo against Libya, and this very same mission reported a violation of the arms embargo by Turkey and the UAE, yet EU Member States still supply Turkey, the UAE and all the other countries breaking this arms embargo with weapons, and some of these weapons end up with Sarraj, others end up with Haftar, all fuelling the violence. And Mr Borrell, I really wouldn’t want to be in your shoes trying to build a consistent EU foreign policy on that mess.
And then, my dear colleagues from EPP, there’s the arms industry: the arms industry that already today complains that all these national regulations make cooperation super difficult, that arms export decisions are not reliable and that they cannot do business that way. And to be frank, I totally get their point. And dear colleagues, all these examples clearly show that if we want to do joint arms production, we need to do joint arms export control as one EU. What I really don’t understand is why the Commission, the Member States and parts of this Parliament are pushing so much for an internal defence market for joint arms production ˗ even putting money into it ˗ and at the same time, the very same people refuse to even discuss an EU-level involvement in democratic oversight and export control and thereby undermine what they want to reach: a European defence union and strategic autonomy of the European Union.
I want to thank all my shadows for the very fierce and fair debates we had in the negotiations. We’ve reached a lot, but on this point we didn’t reach consensus, and that’s why I decided to bring it to the parliamentary debate today. I’m very much looking forward to the discussion.

But let’s not stop halfway. If we want the EU to play a role in this world in chaos, and if we want to build a true European defence union, we need to join in arms production, but we also need to join in oversight and arms export control. Et je comprends bien que ce sujet est une prérogative nationale, oui, but there is one thing that this European project has taught us: no one is going to come, Mr Borrell, and give this European Union and this Commission any competences all by themselves, and no one is going to come and offer this Parliament any rights for scrutiny, oversight or control. If we do not claim it and fight for it, it’s not going to happen. 
And that’s why I call on all pro-European parties in this House – and I deliberately include PPE and Renew in this one – to vote tomorrow for Amendment 19; to vote for Amendment 19 that calls on the Member States and Commission to translate the Common Position on EU arms export, the Common Position that was reaffirmed by all 27 Member States one year ago, to transfer this Common Position into EU law. And to do it, to finish what we started, and make sure that the European Union can really control where EU arms, arms produced inside the EU, end up in this world in chaos.

And now I’m standing here again: nothing happened. Even worse, when I asked the Commission about it this March, I received the following answer: the Commission is, and I quote, ‘not aware of systemic problems faced by human rights defenders fulfilling the necessary entry conditions in being granted short-stay visas’. Seriously?
Özgür Gür was supposed to speak at a round table at Parliament on 15 October last year. He’s a 25-year-old LGBTI activist. He applied for a Schengen visa with the Belgian embassy. The MEP hosting the event even called the embassy. Still he didn’t receive a visa. Tomorrow, Özgür Gür is facing trial in Turkey for organising a non-violent protest for LGBTI rights.
There are so many more people like Özgür Gür, because to get a visa, you should be married, have a proper job, a regular income, you should not have been in prison or in conflict with state authorities. Well, human rights defenders living in oppressive countries can rarely fulfil these criteria, precisely because of the work they do, because of the work we ask them to do and we encourage them to do. And then the Commission speaks of no systemic problems?
Mr Borrell, you know this as much as I do. Human rights defenders are our partners. Without them, we can do nothing when it comes to promoting human rights globally, and their space is shrinking. And now our own visa policies are shrinking their space even more. So I really urge you to get together with Commissioner Johansson to stop this injustice and adapt the Visa Handbook, to make sure that they can travel and network and go to conferences. Because our role as the European Union is to support and protect those fighting for democracy and human rights, and not to make their lives even more difficult.

But in its shadow a human rights crisis is unfolding and this human rights crisis is making the health emergency even worse. 
If regimes attack and kidnap journalists who report on the pandemic, it doesn’t stop the virus, it just spreads disinformation and mistrust.
If regimes use corona funds to buy weapons for their police to enforce lockdowns, it doesn’t stop the virus. It only spreads fear and death. 
Of course, restrictions to individual freedoms are necessary to fight the pandemic, but each and every restriction needs to be proportionate. It needs to be clearly linked to the health emergency and above all, people have to be allowed to debate them and often they are not. 
So, to fight the COVID-19 crisis globally, we need to tackle both the health emergency and the human rights crisis. We need to monitor the spread of the disease and the human rights violations. We need to investigate deaths and human rights violations. We need to protect our doctors and our human rights defenders.
Mr Borrell, it’s not just about millions. Team Europe needs to become Team Human Rights. And while I applaud your efforts in this regard, and you have spoken up strongly, I really think that we need to step up our actions on this one as well, looking at the world of today.

Mir ist es oft wirklich hochnotpeinlich, wenn wir mit EP-Delegationen ins Ausland reisen, und da sind nur Männer; wenn unser Europäischer Auswärtiger Dienst in den Krisenregionen keine einzige Botschaft hat, die von einer Frau geführt wird. Ich würde mich einfach sehr freuen, wenn wir in dieser Strategie nicht nur innenpolitisch rangehen und nicht nur mit dem Finger auf andere zeigen, sondern uns auch wirklich an unsere eigene Nase fassen und unsere eigenen Strukturen da nochmal angucken.

Ja, die EU leistet humanitäre Hilfe. Das ist wichtig, und es muss weitergehen. Aber sie kann mehr tun: voller diplomatischer Einsatz für einen Waffenstillstand, Dokumentation der Kriegsverbrechen, Ausweitung der Sanktionen auch auf Verantwortliche in Russland und der Türkei, und ja, Aufnahmekontingente für die Schwächsten, sollten sie es je aus Idlib heraus schaffen.
Herr Borrell, diese umfassende politische Lösung für Syrien, die hat gerade niemand.

This has been addressed already, so let me add another important aspect. The killing of Soleimani threatened to overshadow the voices of those protesters who had been calling for political reforms in both Iran and Iraq for months. But since Friday, they are back in the streets, despite mounting threats, again and they are even louder. And I also want to see EU action on this – to protect them from violence and killing, to fill the void that a withdrawal of US forces would leave in Iraq and to use all diplomatic ways to send a clear message to the Iranian regime. Yes, we need to deal with the big power politics, but there will never be peace in the region if the voices of those in the streets are silenced once more.

That we use it to protect all those fighting for democracy and human rights. 
Why is it that trade deals can protect business but not humans? Why do European companies still make a fortune selling weapons to warmongers? Why can’t so many human rights defenders still not come to the EU if they need protection? And why is it that European companies still destroy the livelihoods of so many indigenous people, only to mine coal?
Mr Borrell, with this report, we want to change those things. It is a strong report, carried by a very large majority in this House. I hope it will guide your work for the next five years. Thank you, Isabel Wiseler-Lima for your great work on this.

Davon aber finden wir im GSVP-Bericht von Herrn Danjean leider kaum etwas. Kritische Analyse bestehender EU-Missionen – Fehlanzeige, mehr Geld für Krisenprävention – abgelehnt, obwohl es im Bericht von Herrn McAllister steht. Und bei der europäischen Rüstungsexportpolitik, die für die Aufrüstung mitverantwortlich ist, kann angeblich alles so bleiben. Stattdessen fordert der Bericht mehrfach, die Militärausgaben auf 2 % des Bruttoinlandsproduktes zu steigern.
So, und da hört unsere konstruktive Zusammenarbeit dann auch wirklich auf, weil es uns um eine regelbasierte europäische Sicherheitspolitik geht, eine mit einer angemessenen Mischung aus zivilen und militärischen Maßnahmen, weil es so in den europäischen Verträgen steht und weil man nur so wirklich Frieden schafft.

Two weeks ago in this House we congratulated ourselves on the successful demonstrations and how they have changed our lives for the better. Since this summer we have seen demonstrations in many countries around the Middle East. Algeria: ongoing. Egypt: violent and cruel crackdown. Lebanon: a Prime Minister stepping down and an old elite clinging to power. Iraq: their protest is met with the utmost violence. About 350 are dead. Iran: a massive media blackout. We don’t even have viable information, but more than 100 are dead for sure.
In all of these uprisings we see people taking their claims to the street against corruption and for participation, against repression and for democracy. What is new in this protest is that they don’t care anymore about sectarian or regional boundaries. We are all Iraqis is what they shout in the streets of Baghdad, and that is apparently scaring the old elites.
A tear gas canister fired at the head of a 17-year-old in Baghdad, a mother in jail for posting on Facebook in Cairo, protesters greeting security forces with flowers and met with live ammunition in Shiraz in Iran. And we, the European Union, the ones that have just celebrated 30 years of peaceful revolution, we are bystanders once more.
In Iraq we have been present for years. We have supported with humanitarian aid. We have had reconstruction projects. We actually have a mission on security sector reform in the very same country where medics are shot in the back when treating the wounded, where snipers are firing at peaceful protesters. And those in the streets of Iraq, they refused the interference of Iran and the US and they are very clear about that.
The UN has lost its credibility and protesters are clearly, clearly calling on us, the European Union, to fill the void, to organise dialogue, to stop the killing, to investigate the abuses, to do a proper security-sector reform and to just teach them crowd control. And the EU is issuing statements without commitments.
Let me be clear, doing nothing or only a little in such a situation can actually do a lot of harm. We failed the demonstrators of the Arab Spring in 2011, and we should not let them down once again. We are all human beings and we are human beings with human rights.

Hannah NEUMANN,2019-11-13,EN,International day to end impunity for crimes against journalists (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-13-INT-1-260-0000_EN.html,"  Hannah Neumann (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, information is the enemy of repression, and that is why repressive regimes target journalists first. They intimidate them; they block media outlets; they kill them. And when they get away with it, they move on. Social media is blocked; tweets can get you into prison. Next, the internet is shut down. But how can we actually know what is happening on the streets of Baghdad, Hong Kong, Santiago de Chile if no one is left to report? Tonight, I received a message from a friend in Iraq. ‘Every night at six,’ he said, ‘they shut down the internet and then they come and kill us and no one is there to watch.’ Sadly, this friend is right. Impunity of crimes against journalists just encourages another round of violence and repression. I want us to break this pattern here and elsewhere because there can never be freedom without freedom of the press.

Im September sind tausende Menschen in Ägypten auf die Straße gegangen. Und das war neu: Sie sind überall im Land auf die Straße gegangen, sie haben gegen Korruption gekämpft, dagegen, dass das Geld, das dem Land und den Bürgern geliehen wird für den Bau von Straßen, von Schulen, von Krankenhäusern, verschwindet und dass es viel zu langsam vorwärtsgeht. Das Regime hat den Protest gewaltsam niedergeschlagen, 4 300 Menschen wurden verhaftet, darunter viele Kinder. Hunderte verschwanden, Menschenrechtler werden bis heute gezielt ins Visier genommen, soziale Medien und Messenger-Dienste sind überwacht.
Die Botschaft ist klar: Al-Sisi duldet keine Kritik an seiner Herrschaft, und leider kommt sie an. Menschenrechtlerinnen und Menschenrechtler trauen sich heute nur noch im Exil, über die Gewalt zu sprechen. Und was macht die EU? Sie schweigt. Sie überweist Budgethilfe an die Regierung, und Mitgliedstaaten exportieren weiter Überwachungstechnologie und Waffen. Ich war diese Woche zum ersten Mal mitverantwortlich für einen Entschließungsantrag, und ich kann Ihnen sagen, die Verhandlungen über diese Entschließung waren nicht einfach, weil wir uns alle auf wirklich wichtige Konsequenzen geeinigt haben und damit ans Eingemachte gegangen sind. Und am Ende haben sich alle Verantwortlichen geeinigt, und darauf bin ich sehr stolz. Denn wir sagen eines ganz deutlich: Ja, Ägypten ist ein Partner der Europäischen Union, aber wir wollen nicht länger Komplizen dieses Regimes sein. Das heißt: Schluss mit business as usual mit Al-Sisi und Freiheit für die Protestierenden. Und ganz konkret: Keine Spionagetechnik mehr in die Hände dieses Regimes. Es darf doch nicht sein, dass wir in Europa damit auch noch Geld verdienen. Das heißt: Kein Blankoscheck mehr für EU-Gelder an das Regime, sondern Überprüfung der Budgethilfe und Stärkung der Zivilgesellschaft. Und – und das geht an die Kommission – endlich klare Kante in diplomatischen Verhandlungen und Statements!
Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, ich habe draußen meinen Koffer stehen und ich fliege jetzt gleich nach Ägypten und ich sage Ihnen: Ich würde diese Entschließung wirklich gerne mitnehmen, weil ich weiß, dass sie vielen Menschen Hoffnung macht – und ja, einigen auch Kopfschmerzen. Wer die Rechte seiner Bürger mit Füßen tritt, der muss mit Konsequenzen rechnen. Lassen Sie uns dieses Signal heute gemeinsam in aller Deutlichkeit nach Ägypten senden!

Es ist das gute Recht der Menschen im Irak, auf die Straße zu gehen und zu protestieren. Trotzdem wurden mehr als hundert von ihnen durch Schüsse getötet, mehr als viertausend verletzt, Journalisten wurden daran gehindert, die Proteste zu filmen, das Internet wurde blockiert. Die Berichte von Menschenrechtsorganisationen sind sehr klar: Es waren auch irakische Sicherheitskräfte, die auf die unbewaffneten Demonstranten gefeuert haben. Die irakische Regierung hat zwar eine Untersuchung der Vorfälle angekündigt, Antworten aber blieb sie schuldig. Stattdessen werden immer mehr Aktivisten bedroht oder verschwinden in Haft, und neue Proteste sind für diesen Freitag angekündigt.
Was mich als Mitglied dieses Parlaments beunruhigt: Seit zwei Jahren haben wir eine beratende Mission der EU im Innenministerium des Irak. Sie ist zuständig für die Reform des Sicherheitssektors. Im vergangenen Jahr haben wir die Mission noch mal von 50 auf 95 Personen aufgestockt. Diese Mission berät gerade genau diejenigen, die maßgeblich für die exzessive und tödliche Gewalt in den letzten Wochen verantwortlich sind.
Daher meine Frage an Sie, Frau Tuppurainen: Welche Konsequenzen wird die EU-Mission im Irak aus diesem Desaster ziehen? Wie kann eine unparteiische Untersuchung der Vorfälle garantiert werden? Und vor allem: Wie wollen Sie sicherstellen, dass es am kommenden Freitag nicht wieder zu Menschenrechtsverletzungen durch das von der EU beratene Ministerium und seine Behörden kommt? Es ist Zeit, dass wir endlich auch im Plenum über unsere Missionen im Ausland diskutieren.

Viele von Ihnen kennen diese Tradition sicherlich, am Internationalen Frauentag, dem 8. März, Blumen an Frauen zu verschenken. Es ist ein friedliches – ich muss sagen, mir selber manchmal zu friedliches – Zeichen für die Rechte der Frauen. Eigentlich – denn am 8. März dieses Jahres haben Frauen im Iran, in Teheran, in der Metro Blumen verschenkt.
In Teheran sind in der Metro das erste und das letzte Abteil für Frauen reserviert, und drei Frauen nahmen dort ihren Schleier ab und haben ihr Anliegen sehr deutlich zum Ausdruck gebracht. Sie haben gesagt: Ich hoffe, dass wir mit und ohne Schleier eines Tages gemeinsam auf der Straße in Teheran im Iran marschieren können, denn im Iran ist genug Platz für alle IranerInnen da. Man sieht auf einem Video, das in den sozialen Medien geteilt wurde, wie Frauen mit und ohne Schleier sich umarmen, wie es Applaus gibt. Die Spannung und auch ein Gefühl des Aufbruchs sind richtig zu spüren.
Und was war die Reaktion des iranischen Regimes? Inhaftierung, Schikane, Gefängnis bis zu 24 Jahren. Und das ist nicht der einzige Fall. Nasrin Sotudeh, die von uns hier im Parlament den Sacharow-Preis bekommen hat, wurde selbst zu 33 Jahren und 148 Peitschenhieben verurteilt, weil sie Frauen wie die in der Metro vor Gericht verteidigt hat.
Eines zeigen uns diese Strafen ganz deutlich: Das iranische Regime fühlt sich von diesen mutigen Frauen bedroht.
Ja, die Lage in der Region ist wahrlich kompliziert, und sie wurde in den letzten Tagen nochmal komplizierter. Aber ich finde, gerade dann, wenn das mit Gut und Böse nicht so einfach ist, müssen wir hier an der Seite der Menschen stehen, die sich für Menschenrechte starkmachen, die im Iran gegen Diskriminierung von Frauen kämpfen, wie die Frauen in der Metro, gegen Diskriminierung wie ein ungerechtes Scheidungssystem, wie sexuelle Gewalt. Und da gibt es noch so viel anderes Unrecht.
Wenn anderswo die Rechte von Menschen missachtet werden, dann dürfen wir hier in diesem Haus nicht schweigen. Deswegen: Lasst uns gemeinsam nachher für diese Entschließung und für die Frauen im Iran unterzeichnen!

Hannah NEUMANN,2019-07-16,EN,Situation in the Persian Gulf (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-07-16-INT-2-240-0000_EN.html,"  Hannah Neumann,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the Iran nuclear deal was a diplomatic success by a united European Union and it was rare enough, a deal mainly negotiated by women. Ms Mogherini, you were part of that negotiation process. However, four years later, this common achievement is in danger.
It is in danger because an irresponsible US President is jeopardising it. It is in danger because the Iranian regime is again stepping up its uranium enrichment. But it is also in danger because EU foreign policy is not yet strong enough to counterbalance this escalation. The recent events in the Persian Gulf that we are discussing here today have shown how one spark, and just one spark, might be enough to trigger a violent escalation that nobody wants. It is for all of us today, and in the coming weeks, to make sure that this conflict does not escalate further in a region that is already ravaged by war.
In this regard, we as Greens welcome the decision taken yesterday by the Foreign Affairs Council to find solutions to preserve the deal. Yes, the USA and Iran need to talk, but I also want to see the EU supporting the call for a regional conference that was issued by Iraq, for example. This could be a conference at which all regional actors sit at the table and work on a sustainable solution.
But let’s be clear on one thing: this can be done only if the grave human rights abuses that have been committed are also addressed. So we also need to talk about the journalists killed, about the human rights defenders in prison and about the humanitarian aid that is currently not being granted to many people.
Together we are strong, and the European Union is needed today more than ever to protect a rules—based international order. And I want to see us, including the Member States, deliver on this ambition in the coming years.
