Reinhard BÜTIKOFER,2023-12-13,EN,EU-Japan relations (A9-0373/2023 - Reinhard Bütikofer)  (vote),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-124-0000_EN.html,"  Reinhard Bütikofer,  rapporteur. – Madam President, colleagues, it’s been at least 10 years since we have not looked at the wider relationship between the EU and Japan, even though Japan obviously is one of our best and most important likeminded partners globally. 
The economic relations have thrived, but as regards other dimensions, including security, research and development, global high-quality infrastructure development, the dual digital and green transformation, upholding the multinational international order, working with developing nations or enhancing people to people contacts, there is much we can do beyond what we have. 
This report describes where we are and where we want to go. Next year, we will have an anniversary in that relationship, and I hope that this report can contribute to taking it to new heights. Thank you to all the shadows and all the staff.

It’s a policy directed against 1 million Tibetan children and against the whole Tibetan nations. A diligently planned policy organised with the utmost brutally bureaucratic efficiency, a comprehensive and unrelenting push for the forced assimilation of the Tibetan young generation, pursued with the goal of depriving them of their cultural heritage, of cynically transforming them into willing colonial subjects of Great Han nationalism. This policy is a radical remake of oppressive so-called development policies, under the excuse of cultural enhancement that had been pursued by US, Canadian and Australian authorities against indigenous ethnic groups in their countries. The goal is the destruction of Tibetan culture. Even the name Tibet is attacked. They tried to annihilate the name. China has made a lot of hay with criticising the history of European colonialism, but Xi’s regime itself is a colonial regime, and that’s why we should stand in solidarity with the Tibetan people against them.

I also want to state that I’m proud that this Parliament, over the last almost five years, has done quite a lot to consequently work on enhancing the relationship between the EU and Taiwan. The debate today is another step in that direction, and I think that is very important.
I do recognise, Vice-President, that the Commission also has stepped up its efforts, as you explained, and I do also support your expectation towards Taiwan that there is homework to be done on their side also, in particular with regard to the issues that you mentioned, offshore wind and agricultural food products. But I also want to point out that when we look at what the US does or what Japan just did, in agreeing on memorandums of understanding or in trade facilitation deals with Taiwan, there’s room to improve our work.
Here I want to voice a warning. As colleague Winzig said, we have to combine trade and political stability and the effort to reap the fruits of trade without actively contributing to political stability will be futile.
We cannot just dodge the question, Vice-President, of whether we’re willing to sign an agreement with Taiwan. We need a resilient supply chain agreement, not just because of the beneficial trade results, but also because of the beneficial stability results, and the Commission should not dodge that necessity.

There’s a lot that I would criticise or do criticise about the way in which the Netanyahu government conducts this self-defence against Hamas, but I think it is not right to put so much of the blame just one-sidedly on Israel.
You said, and I quote you, ‘Israel refuses a political solution’. Now, I have two questions there. Number one: do you have an idea of how to solve the issue of Hamas terror politically? Second: has Hamas offered a political solution? Why just put the blame on Israel?
Then people have said here Israel is sowing the seed of hate. Somebody else said terror is now spreading in Gaza. Has that terror not come from Gaza? Let’s not talk as if all the blame could put on Israel. I think that will not make us a partner in solutions.

That’s why I’m grateful to President von der Leyen and also executive Vice-President Dombrovskis for taking the lead in this conversation. And I do agree with what you said, Mr Borrell, that we look to need to look into the governance issues and maybe also learn from Japan in that context. We need a full picture of our strategic dependencies and risks, and we should encourage the Member States to play along well in that regard. We should not think that we have seen all the dangers over the horizon yet. I believe that there is a real risk that there will be waves of dumping exports from China over the next couple of years. We must not fall into the trap of having a struggle between the Member States and Brussels. We must not fall into the trap of protectionism, and we must not fall into the trap of forgetting the strength of the single market. There, I agree with Mr Ferber, but there is more that we have to do long term. We need a strategy to internalise the external cost of security in our economies. And finally, if we want to play offence, we also need to team up with partners globally, including in countries of the Global South.

Reinhard BÜTIKOFER,2023-12-12,EN,EU-US relations (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-12-INT-2-492-0000_EN.html,"  Reinhard Bütikofer,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, HR/VP, colleagues, the bottom line of our relationship with the United States can be captured in one sentence: ‘we should be partners in leadership and responsibility’, as you have quoted from the text. DC has often asked us to shoulder more responsibility, and that’s justified. But they do not always listen when we ask for more partnership in leadership.
However, the United States is not anymore the shining city on the hill that we can just always follow. Still, there’s a necessity to build on the partnership, to strengthen the partnership. But we almost also must address issues where we are not seeing eye to eye. And with regard to multilateralism, that pertains in particular to the trade realm, where the US often talk about rules-based order, but whenever it comes to WTO, they forget it. We need to be cooperating also with other like-minded partners in order to impress on our US partners that we want to shape the future.
And the last point is the most urgent one: that is Ukraine. What the US Congress is deliberating at the moment can be captured with the English saying ‘penny wise, pound foolish’: to not spend the money on supporting Ukraine would be suicidal in the strategic long term.

Of course, we can hope that at some point in the future, China may again try to become a responsible stakeholder, but presently, let’s not fool ourselves. China is a dictatorial and totalitarian regime with global hegemonic ambitions. 
I want to make just a few remarks on China’s foreign policy and our interests in that regard. Look at what happens in the Philippines neighbourhood. We have to push back hard against China’s efforts to change the facts in the sea. Maybe having multilateral patrols would be a good idea. Look at Taiwan, in January, there will be presidential election. China already threatens to coerce the new newly elected president. We should prepare for pushing back. Look at Hamas. China has not even called them a terrorist organisation. Look at the wave of dumping exports that is coming our way. Josep Borrell spoke a little bit about that. Look about Ukraine, where China supports Russia materially and politically. We have to call a spade a spade. And even as regards climate, you love saying, Vice-President Borrell, that China is a necessary partner. I would say they are necessary alright, but not yet a partner in that regard. So let’s do realistic policy and not pursue pipe dreams.

You dwelt quite extensively on historic issues and you spoke about the European spirit of Bulgaria that your national hero emphasised, and I’m sure all of us loved it. You quoted JFK, and I like that too. So let me ask you this question: what will Bulgaria do for the EU with regard to EU enlargement?
You didn’t mention the name of your neighbouring country, North Macedonia, whose access so far has been blocked by Bulgaria. In vague terms only you seemed to question the real will of candidate countries. Can anybody question the real European will of North Macedonia, a country that even went as far as changing its name in order to open the door to Europe?
After Mr Dzhambazki spewed hate against North Macedonia here, I would like to ask you, Prime Minister, to be more specific. What will you do to help open the door for North Macedonia? I believe Bulgaria must avoid hampering the accession process with overhyped national blockades.

Step by step, all the freedoms guaranteed under the Hong Kong Basic Law are being suffocated in violation of international law, and I join the criticism of colleague Lexmann that the Council has been dodging these developments. We demand on you to speak up.
The freedom of press is denied. The freedom of association, the freedom of speech, and the freedom of the vote. Not a single opposition candidate has been allowed to run for the district elections, because if just one opposition person would be elected, everybody would be able to see through the ruse of the totalitarian measures.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has urged Hong Kong to repeal the national security law, but instead hundreds have been arrested – some in custody since 2021, without trial, even in solitary confinement.
I would say we should focus on five demands in dealing with Hong Kong. First of all, don’t forget the fate of the democratic fighters like courageous Chow Hang-tung, who gave a very good speech in defence of democracy at her trial. So continue and guarantee trial observation.
Second, sanction John Lee. John Lee is one of the main culprits of these measures. Do not normalise the relationship with his regime. Make sure, through a business advisory, that European companies will not inadvertently become complicit and raise these issues and tell the public how you do that at the upcoming China EU summit.

It is indeed a historic date. And there are four clear winners on this historic date. There’s Ukraine and Moldova, where the leadership and the people together are moving in our direction. And there are two nations, the people of Georgia and the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have upheld the flame of going into the direction of a European orientation. We can congratulate them.
But there’s also a new tone. And I want to highlight that. I share the criticism that my colleagues Picula and Moretti have said about the Serbian case. I think this is also an hour where the whitewashing of Serbia, where the appeasement against Serbia, will begin to end. And I read this in the sentence from the President of the Commission when she said that all countries have to take a choice between going the European direction or going the authoritarian direction. And you, Commissioner, will not hold us back with your appeasement policies.

Seit dem Ende der Shoah, die immer mit dem Namen meines Landes verbunden bleiben wird, sind an keinem einzigen Tag mehr Menschen jüdischen Glaubens ermordet worden als am 7.  Oktober bei dem heimtückischen, barbarischen Massaker der Hamas. In ihrem grenzenlosen Vernichtungswillen knüpfen diese Terroristen unmittelbar bei den Nazis an. Gegen diesen Vernichtungswillen verdient Israel unsere unumschränkte Solidarität. Israel verteidigt sich, Israel muss sich verteidigen, und Europa muss das wenigstens verstehen.
Viele weltweit sind vor allem bewegt vom Leid der Palästinenser in Gaza. Ihnen sage ich: Ja! Ja, wir brauchen die Einhaltung des humanitären Völkerrechts, wir brauchen humanitäre Korridore und humanitäre Hilfe. Aber vergessen wir nicht: Es braucht auch den Schritt, der am meisten dazu beitragen könnte, dass diese Eskalation nicht weitergeht, nämlich die Freilassung, die bedingungslose Freilassung der Geiseln, die die Hamas hält.
Und wir sollten eine Warnung aussprechen an Hisbollah und Iran: Die Weltgemeinschaft wird es nicht vergessen, wenn sie jetzt weiter Öl ins Feuer gießen! Der Weg zum Frieden ist lang, aber er ist möglich.

This is about specific human rights issues. And I think it is right to say that we have common ground with India in that regard and that we should reinforce, as the resolution says, the EU—India human rights dialogue. And, in particular, I would underscore the sentence that says there should be regular dialogue organised between the European Parliament and the Parliament of India.
My colleague Simon has said he doesn’t want to wag his finger at India. He couldn’t do without wagging though, so he wagged his finger at the Greens. I will not retaliate, I will just say we will defend religious freedom wherever it is endangered, be it Christians or otherwise.

But some of those that cannot find enough hyperbole in criticising Israel turn quite gingerly when it comes to calling a spade a spade on the Palestinian side. Let me direct your attention to three amendments, namely amendments 45, 47 and 48 that try to deal with the issue of Palestinian terrorism. Several groups in this House seem to be determined to vote them down. I say that would be a very bad mistake.

But in this debate, a Member of Parliament from the ID Group thinks it’s adequate to spew anti-Muslim hatred. What a shame!
But the question also goes to ourselves. Do we draw the necessary conclusions? Are we living up to our duty? Dodik is pursuing a blatant secessionist policy. I challenge you, Commissioner, to say it here: ‘blatant secessionist policy’. Call a spade a spade, and then let’s sanction him.

All the more grateful we can be that we have heard strong and clear voices recently regarding the EU’s China policy. I want to start by congratulating President von der Leyen for her China speech and for how she conducted her visit in China. That showed leadership.
There are of course, as you have said, Josep Borrell, different interests, but that cannot be an excuse for divergence on the fundamentals. The focus on human rights is not an accessoire for our foreign policy; it’s at the centre and we’re not selling it for a lentil stew.
We’re willing to cooperate with our systemic rival, China. But cooperation cannot be a one-way street. We have to be clear-eyed. China is a revisionist power with hegemonic ambition, aiming at building a Beijing-centric global order. If they would respect the principles of the United Nations, they would have called for Russia to leave Ukraine alone.
We must work together with like-minded partners in our China policy, in particular in cooperation with the US. Whoever splits that front is not serving our own values and interests. Strategic autonomy à la française would be risky for Europe. Mutual solidarity with democracies is basic, and that includes Taiwan’s democracy. In our relations with countries of the Global South, we must strive to be a better partner for them than China. And we must, as has been laid out by the President, de-risk in our economic relations in order to secure our economies. There is no way back, therefore, to the win-win illusion that shaped CAI. At the end, let me say we should never confuse the Chinese people and the great Chinese culture and their successes with the dictatorship of the totalitarian Xi Jinping regime.

Es ist in der Tat schlimm, dass wir die Kapazität unserer Rüstungsindustrie hochfahren müssen.

Deswegen müssen wir das tun.
Ich frage mich, wieso Sie eigentlich ihre Forderungen nicht an das faschistische Regime in Moskau richten, wieso Sie die ganze Zeit so tun, als läge es in der Macht der EU, den Krieg zu beenden! Haben Sie schon einmal zur Kenntnis genommen, dass die Ukraine das Recht auf Selbstverteidigung hat, dass die UNO-Charta verlangt, dass Russland sich zurückziehen muss, die nationale Souveränität und die territoriale Integrität der Ukraine akzeptieren muss? Wenn Sie so hochtrabende Worte im Mund führen, warum sagen Sie das nicht ein einziges Mal?
Nach der Logik, die Sie vertreten, hätte man die Anti-Hitler-Koalition verurteilen müssen, weil sie den Aggressor mit Waffen bekämpft? Das hat nichts mit Friedenspolitik zu tun, Frau Demirel; die Lügen, die Sie hier verbreiten, sind die Lügen der fünften Kolonne Moskaus.

Now, where should the EU stand with regard to transatlantic relations on China? And I have three specific questions. President Biden has said yes to all three. What are you saying? Should there be outbound investment screening? Should there be sanctions if China delivers arms to Russia? And should there be a deterrence policy to avoid an attack on Taiwan?

The Georgian government is paying lip service at best to European values and the European path. We should not let Georgian citizens alone in their fight for the European perspective. That is why we should consider measures beyond what’s been on the table. Will we continue unabated with the development cooperation without conditionality? Will we refuse to consider sanctions? We shouldn’t. And we should fight for the freedom of Saakashvili.

That’s true. But that’s not news. That was true also ten years ago when we experienced the Senkaku crisis. 
But what did we do since? We refused to learn our lessons! Today, we’re more dependent on China than we were at that time. That’s not because China controls all the raw materials, all the rare earths, as rare earths are not really rare, but the processing capacity that China controls, that’s rare and concentrated, and that creates a dependency. 
Even with the greatest realism regarding a max of green mining inside Europe and a max of circularity in the use of raw materials, we will remain a continent depending on critical raw materials imported from other corners of the globe. 
That’s why we must invest in partnerships with other countries, and I’m grateful, Commissioner, that you mentioned the Global Gateway Initiative. That should be the tool that we employ to create the win—win partnerships that help us in overcoming these dependencies.

Because she proposed a plan to revive, to reorient and to enlarge in scope an initiative that had originally been promoted by her predecessor, Juncker, in the waning days of his own presidency. 
The principles of Global Gateway are good. Global Gateway is designed to combine three major thrusts: to invest into international infrastructure development; to promote the green and digital transformation; and to combine that with the geopolitical goals of the European Union. 
But a year and a half later, I’m sometimes tempted to say Global Gateway would be a good idea. Indeed, I agree with the colleagues who have said that it is now time to deliver. When DG INTPA, for instance, last year organised its traditional development days and put the label Global Gateway everywhere but didn’t change a thing on substance, that was not what we expect. That was old wine in new wineskins. Instead of creative geopolitical action, bureaucratic laziness. When one Commissioner says he has 84 lighthouse projects under the label of Global Gateway, he hasn’t understood the idea, obviously. 
The world is waiting for us to put our money where our mouth has been. And Udo Bullmann is right that this is a great opportunity. But Mr Tobé is also right when he says this has to be developed in a mutually beneficial way and we have to develop a real partnership. But that is not going to be successful if we pursue Global Gateway as a kind of Christmas tree project. 
We have to have clear priorities and we have to have the governance right. And what we are still missing is this. We are still missing the Business Advisory Council. We are still missing the civil society dialogue as a permanent exercise. We are still missing the Global Gateway Forum that was proposed in the strategy and that should be organised this autumn. And we will also need – and I think Mrs von der Leyen would be well advised to do that – the nomination of a high-level special envoy to represent Global Gateway for the European Union.

For the EU the next seven years will decide whether we will sit at the table or be on the menu. We have to start with realism, though. Overblown dreams of strategic autonomy can be and must be discarded because we learn in the present situation that without the United States’ support, we would not have been able to hold our own together to support Ukraine. That means we must continue to invest in transatlantic relations, but at the same time, we have to up our own game. We have to increase our capabilities: being an ally is not enough; we must be strong allies.
Second, we must not allow ourselves to be captured by delusions about the nature of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. And that in particular means de-risk our relationship with China. Systemic rivalry is not just between Washington and Beijing. Nostra res agitur.
Third, cooperation with countries of the Global South to promote mutual benefit is not an option anymore, it’s a must – a geopolitical must, and that implies that we have to invest in the Global Gateway initiative.
And finally, the climate crisis has long been a threat—multiplier. This multiplication is getting more dangerous by the year. Fighting climate crisis is not everything, but without effectively fighting climate crisis, everything will come to nought.

In this statement, and I quote, they question ‘the integrity of the foreign policy positions of the EP, as expressed in the urgency resolutions’. This casts a very dark shadow of suspicion and insinuation over the complete human rights work of this Parliament. And unfortunately they do so without the slightest indication that there is any reason to do it. They just take the corruption scandal that we have to fight against as an excuse for trying to kill the urgencies that they wanted to kill anyway.
Rule 144(2) of our Rules of Procedure states, and I quote, ‘[t]he Conference of Presidents shall draw up a list of subjects to be included in the final draft agenda for the next debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law on the basis of the request referred to in paragraph 1 and in accordance with the provisions of Annex IV. The total number of subjects included in the agenda shall not exceed three, including sub—chapters.’
On this basis, I request that the President ensures that the work of this Parliament on human rights that is founded in this paragraph of Rule 144 shall not be obstructed by the EPP, who call for a stop of all the work.

Our friends and partners in the United States are deviating important investment from the European to the US markets, thus effectively promoting European deindustrialisation somewhat, even if unintended. That runs counter to our shared interest, also to their own. And it has effects beyond just the economic dimension because it contributes to a creeping crisis of trust. 
Of course, I wish you well, Executive Vice-President, with the talks that you have ahead of you, but I will still reserve judgment as to what can effectively be done in the negotiations. So we have to focus on what we can do ourselves. I certainly support the reform of state aid rules. I think we should invest together, as Ernest Urtasun has emphasised, in a smart, fair and WTO-compatible way. And we should also go back to looking at the fragmentation that still exists in the single market and try to overcome that. One thing we should not do: we should not retaliate against protectionism with our own protectionism.

Gestern noch hat der Kollege David Leger von der EVP die Verhandlungen, die sehr harmonischen und konsensualen Verhandlungen über die Entschließung, über die wir morgen abstimmen werden, geleitet. Ich bedaure, dass er heute nicht als Koautor hier reden kann.
Zur Sache. Ich glaube, dass die landesweiten Proteste in China gegen die sogenannte Zero-Covid Policy der chinesischen Führung ein Ereignis von historischer Bedeutung darstellen. Da hat sich im Verhältnis zwischen dem Unterdrückerregime und dem unterdrückten Volk etwas geändert. Jahrzehntelang hatte es das nicht gegeben, dass sich landesweit Protest erhebt. Jahrzehntelang hatte es das nicht gegeben, dass Menschen aus den verschiedensten sozialen Gruppen gemeinsam protestieren. Und jahrzehntelang hatte es nicht gegeben, dass solche Forderungen direkt an die zentralen Verantwortlichen in Peking gerichtet werden. Die Pekinger Führung hat selber dafür gesorgt, dass dieser große Protest zustande gekommen ist. Und die Perspektive der chinesischen Freiheit, die im Moment so weit entfernt zu sein scheint, ist durch diese Proteste stärker geworden und näher gerückt.

My point of order is the request that Ms Zovko should be sanctioned because first, she misused a China debate to enact a hypocritical theatre, charging everybody else as culprits in a criminal gang system. And I also want to have her criticised for not even having the respect for her colleagues to wait until the question to her has been asked. I think that is completely objectionable behaviour. She should be sanctioned.

I believe the protection of strategic infrastructure cannot just be expected from the executive branch of government. We need an all-of-society effort to deal with the integrated multi-actor activities from the Chinese side. 
In that regard, I think it’s important to raise the awareness of the public. I think the Commission should look into opportunities for supporting, for instance, mapping efforts by academia or think tanks that would help to raise awareness. Also, I believe that often on the local level there is a lack of China competency. In twinning relationships, small towns of below 100 000 inhabitants are twinned with several million inhabitants in a big Chinese metropolis. They could be overwhelmed. So there should be efforts to enhance their China competency to deal with these issues. 
And finally, the EU cannot impose a European port strategy, but the European Union can support efforts by national actors, by regional actors to coordinate. And there we have not been doing what we should be doing.

Some Member States, like the Dutch or the Swedish, have invested into creating national China competency centres or different institutions that help creating that competency that we need on all societal levels. And I think it would be helpful if the Commission could put some effort into propagating those shining examples.

That sounds nice, but how strategic is it really? 
We learned today from the media that the two sides have not been able to agree on common language about Taiwan or issues around Taiwan. 
So I think we should not fool ourselves. That strategic partnership is still much more of a promise and an aspiration than it is a reality. And I think we should clearly identify priority projects to make it a real strategic partnership. I think one of them would be, as Mr McAllister said, a region-to-region FTA. One of them would be cooperating on trusted connectivity projects and one would be systematic cooperation in international organisations.

To say it simply, Mr Borrell, I’m disappointed. I heard from you a lot of generalities, but very little indeed about the reality of EU-China relations.
Maybe there isn’t so much to report. What kind of a relationship do we have after all? The April summit, as you said, was a dialogue of the deaf. At the G20, Xi didn’t want to meet with the representatives of the EU. And at the COP 27, China stood squarely in the way of what we fought for.
There is no point in putting lipstick on a pig: EU China relations are at a very low ebb. China’s attitude is characterised by arrogance, divisiveness and hegemonic ambition. Unfortunately, many of our Member States are not yet prepared to learn the Russian lesson fully and to apply the Russian lesson to China: that we should not allow ourselves to become dependent on an authoritarian regime.
Scholz, Macron, Meloni or Sánchez, they all prefer to put their narrow self-interest in the first place. I would have thought that the English proverb ‘once bitten, twice shy’ might apply. But some people may want to be bitten more often, and they will if their self-centred actions, instead of developing common European China policies, will continue. We have a lot of common talk, but very little common walk.
In this context, I would expect of you, Mr Borrell, to take the lead and lead towards unitary European action. What about taking the lead with regard to getting rid of the extradition agreements that we have, of trying to use the EEAS services to counter Chinese representatives spreading the Russian lies in the Global South?
There is so much you could do, but you don’t take the lead.

Wie wird die Kooperation mit unseren Konnektivitätspartnern Japan und Indien forciert?
Zum Zweiten zur Chinapolitik: Ziehen wir die richtigen Konsequenzen aus der russischen Erfahrung? Xi Jinpings Regime wird immer repressiver nach innen und immer gefährlicher nach außen. China unterstützt die Aggression Russlands in der Ukraine ganz offen. Welche Schritte sehen Sie vor, um Taiwan besser zu unterstützen, um die europäische Menschenrechtspolitik wegen Xinjiang deutlicher zu machen, statt die Kritik von Frau Bachelet herunterzuspielen, und um wirkliche Unabhängigkeit im Wirtschaftsbereich gegenüber China zu erkämpfen?

In the past, many European leaders have rejected the call from Ukraine to provide modern tanks to help the Ukrainian army to fight more effectively. More recently, rumours have it that the American administration might be charting a new course. 
My question to you, High Representative, is, can you inform us where that conversation stands at the moment?

This is why this Parliament has consistently stood in favour of enhancing the EU’s support for Taiwan’s democracy in the context of our own one—China policy.
Unilateral changes of the situation in the Taiwan Straits will continue to meet our strong opposition. We fully condemn the PRC’s threat of the use of force, their continuous provocations and the escalation of threats from Beijing against Taiwan, which are completely unjustified and an escalation of choice. We want to signal to Beijing that a strategy of aggression would come with a very high price for the PRC itself, and we want to deter them from undermining security and peace in the region.
Parliamentary diplomacy has to play a central role in this regard. We will continue travelling to Taiwan. We will invite the Taiwanese parliament, we will organise a parliamentary week and we will all make efforts to convince our colleagues in national parliaments to form a strong phalanx of solidarity with Taiwan.

This Parliament continues to actively show solidarity with Hong Kong democrats against the Chinese Communist oppression.
Last week, several members of this House reminded us of the 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to the mainland authorities, and the second anniversary of the imposition of the national security law. This is the history of a betrayal, the betrayal of the trust of the citizens of Hong Kong and a betrayal also of the international community.
With this joint resolution, we strengthen our resolve to not forget and to not cease supporting. We want the charges dropped against Cardinal Zen, who is a towering figure but is also representing many, many other courageous Hong Kongers. We want the extradition agreements that still exist between EU Member States and the PRC and even Hong Kong terminated. We want lifeboat opportunities created for Hong Kongers that have to flee their city. And we want permanent monitoring of the human rights situation in Hong Kong through our offices there.
We will continue to stand tall. Only extremists from the left and the right do not join this call.

It will breathe a new lease on life into the EU’s enlargement strategy. It will present a chance to overcome the long—blocked effort to heal dangerous European divisions and open wounds. This pertains in particular to the countries in the Western Balkans, most notably Albania and North Macedonia, but also others. 
In doing this, in re-invigorating the enlargement policy, we’re not just being gracious. It is in our own interest not to have a grey zone of minor security, a kind of buffer zone between our borders and those of a revisionist Russia. Not sharing European stability with the Eastern partners that want to join the EU family would undermine our own security and our own future. 
But let me also be explicit about one obvious conditionality for Europe’s united perspective: without Ukraine’s success in defeating the Russian accession, the candidate status promises would fall flat. That’s why providing the necessary arms without hesitation must be enforced.

And that means we cannot allow ourselves to fall into ambivalence. We have to make clear where we stand.
A free and open Indo-Pacific for all: that’s one of our commanding goals. This can be and should be supported by a network of trusted connectivity initiatives like the European Global Gateway Initiative. In the centre of our alliance-building in the region, we should focus on like—minded democracies. We need a strategic solidarity with like—minded democracies and also include other, more or less like—minded countries.
And finally, we should not tiptoe around the elephant in the room, which is the PRC’s aggressive policy in the Indo-Pacific region, responsible for increasing tensions, be that on the Himalayan borders with India or in the South China Sea. We have to call a spade a spade and we have to make clear that Taiwan is also, for us, a democratic partner that we will not give up on.

Deswegen haben Experten der Vereinten Nationen Besorgnis formuliert darüber, dass weiterhin der Vorwurf erhoben wird, dass es in China solche zwangsweisen Organentnahmen, insbesondere bei hingerichteten Gefangenen, gäbe. 
Mir sind keine Fakten bekannt, die belegen würden, dass das tatsächlich seit 2015 stattgefunden hat. Ein Experte der WHO, der verschiedene chinesische Krankenhäuser, die mit Transplantationsmedizin befasst sind, bereist hat, erklärte, er habe Hinweise darauf nicht gefunden, könne aber nicht ausschließen, dass es diese nach wie vor gebe. Insbesondere weil, wie Kollegin Arena gesagt hat, diese Transplantationsmedizin natürlich ein außerordentlich lukratives Geschäft ist. Deswegen wenden wir uns an die chinesischen Behörden und verlangen Klarheit, Transparenz und das Ende einer jeden solchen Praxis, auch in entlegenen Gebieten, auch wo keiner hinguckt.

It was certainly no ‘panda hugging’ event. It was more tense and more controversial than at any time before. 
I’m happy that the European side did raise all the hot button issues, as you said, High Representative. I want to thank you for that. I also want to thank you for the support that you have given to those sanctioned, wherever they are. 
This online summit will, in hindsight, be seen as the one moment in which both EU and China dropped any illusion about win—win cooperation. No more ‘go along to get along’, no covering up the deep divisions. We clearly are in rivalry territory now. 
It has been China’s behaviour vis—à—vis Russia’s aggression against Ukraine that finally laid bare how big the distance has grown. China has formed a revisionist axis with Putin to overturn the multilateral rules—based order. China objected, together with Russia, against the European security order. China, in the case of Lithuania, also dared attacking the Holy Grail of the European Union – namely the single market. 
There is clearly a need for us to push back, and I like Mr Winkler’s language about the push—back, and there shouldn’t be any hesitancy. We should not just implicitly talk about possible sanctions if they support Russia, but explicitly. 
Xi Jinping played hardball at the summit. He played a cynical game. He demonstrated that he does not respect the EU as a partner. They do not want to accept who we are. But when they call for more autonomy, they will get a real geopolitical player. We will have to realise that the tough summit was just the opening of an era in which tough is the new normal, and we need one common European China policy to master that.

Ich möchte diesen Bericht zur Gemeinsamen Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik der Union loben, und die Tatsache, dass meine Fraktion keine Änderungsanträge dazu gestellt hat, reflektiert unsere Zustimmung. Dafür möchte ich dem Berichterstatter, Herrn McAllister, danken. Es ist die Frucht guter Zusammenarbeit.
Mein Lob für den Bericht ist keine Routine. Meine Fraktion hat nicht immer für diese jährlichen Berichte gestimmt. Diesmal können wir es guten Gewissens tun. Drei Punkte möchte ich hervorheben: Der Bericht formuliert eine selbstbewusste, proaktive Antwort auf die wachsenden Herausforderungen durch autoritative Potentaten wie Putin und Xi. Deren Bedrohung wird sich zwar nicht in Luft auflösen, wie die Dragon-Bear-Alliance, die Drachen-Bär-Kooperation zwischen Putin und Xi zeigt. Und ihre aggressive Politik wird nicht verschwinden. Aber wir sind bei Weitem nicht am Ende unserer europäischen Möglichkeiten.
Der Bericht benennt zudem zu Recht die Sicherheitsherausforderungen, die der Klimawandel mit sich bringt. Dafür brauchen wir die Vision einer internationalen Politik der EU, die die grüne Transformation als zentrale Aufgabe betrachtet, ebenso wie die faire Partnerschaft dabei mit allen Ländern unseres Globus. Und schließlich geht es darum, nicht unter der Parole der strategischen Autonomie eine Nabelschau-Politik zu machen, sondern zu verstehen, dass wir die Stärkung der strategischen Souveränität der EU am besten erreichen, indem wir die strategische Solidarität mit Demokratien und anderen gleichgesinnten Ländern üben. Dafür wird insbesondere die Global-Gateway- Initiative der Europäischen Kommission eine zentrale Rolle spielen.

China’s policy is once more on our agenda, and that will happen quite often in the time that we have ahead of us, because China is pursuing an increasingly aggressive, oppressive policy.
I want to thank the democratic political groups in the European Parliament and all the colleagues that contributed to the drafting of this resolution for their efforts, because it is important for the European Parliament to remain a champion of the defence of human rights and the defence of democracy. And this is even more important since the Council has been hesitating, to say the least.
When we look at the facts, it is clear that oppression in Hong Kong is not relenting. Just the opposite: 64 democratic and civic groups have been dissolved over the last year, more than 150 democrats, activists, journalists are languishing in jail, some of them more than a year without having seen a court yet. The last free media have been muzzled.
This is a situation that bears out the worst nightmares that Hong Kong democrats had when they did courageously stand up for democracy. But they’re not shying back: democracy is not dead in Hong Kong. It merits our support, and I call upon the Member States and also our colleagues in the national parliaments to join forces with us in the European Parliament in that regard.
We should not be delusional. If we forget about what China does, China doesn’t forget about us. We see that in the case of Lithuania. China is willing to break all international rules to pursue its hegemonic imperial goals.
Let us carry the flag of the fight for democracy and the fight for human rights. If it’s not possible in Hong Kong to have Fourth of June vigils, let us organise the Fourth of June vigils this year. Let us organise Hong Kong Day on 1 July this year to commemorate our courageous colleagues in Hong Kong.

In 2009, the European Parliament honoured them by bestowing upon them the prize that carries the name of their co—founder, Sakharov. Now, Vladimir Putin, a late admirer and disciple of Stalin, wants to close down Memorial – to ‘liquidate’ Memorial, as they say. Even his language gives testimony to what he represents.
We today express our unbreakable solidarity with Memorial. The torch with which the courageous people of Memorial have carried over 30 years will be carried on. Memorial represents the dignity and Europeanness of Russia.

Will we say this was the moment when, finally, our hope in trade multilateralism collapsed? Or will we be able to say this was the time when we pulled together and created a new progressive agenda for trade multilateralism? It’s obviously not only in our hands, but it also needs our contribution, and the one thing that we need is pragmatism and the one thing that we don’t need is dogmatism. When I listen to Mr Simon who wants to sacrifice solidarity on the altar of intellectual property, that’s not pragmatism, that’s dogmatic. 
We need that pragmatism also when it comes to structural issues like reforming the appellate body, and we need that pragmatism also when we take advantage of plurilateral initiatives to enhance the multilateral overall framework. But we have the choice between pragmatism and dogmatism.

The first TTC meeting in Pittsburgh, however, does not mark the end of our trade controversies with the US. It doesn’t even mark the beginning of the end, but hopefully it marks the end of a new beginning in sorting out some of the issues. This assessment is borne out by what we see as a result of the recent trade and aluminium deal that you negotiated, Executive Vice—President. This is a welcome result, even though it is weaker than we had hoped and issues do remain.
Even more important strategically, I believe, is the standard—setting dimension going forward. Shaping the future, not just sorting out legacy issues. And there we have to work very diligently with the US because this is of geopolitical relevancy. And if you allow me to say that, in the spirit of geopolitical responsibility, wouldn’t it make sense if there would not just be the American Secretary of State, but also our foreign minister?

But these worthy goals are under assault from the People’s Republic of China. Beijing is undermining peace and stability through aggressive actions in many different dimensions. The threat of a military attack against Taiwan is openly being peddled by Chinese ultranationalists. The Chinese dictator Xi Jinping has promised to conquer the island during his lifetime. 
Taiwan, a vibrant democracy and a society with many progressive achievements, needs and merits our strategic solidarity. The Weimers report which we’re discussing here spells that out. It also formulates perspectives for wide—ranging cooperation as partners which is very much in our own interest. 
Our message to the people of Taiwan is clear: we will stand with you. Our message to Beijing is: reconsider your policy. Historical patience will be better for China than any other hypothetical alternative. 
Our message to our European citizens, not only in Lithuania, is let’s stay united on China policy. I thank Charlie Weimers for his report and all the colleagues for their good cooperation, and I thank Vice—President Vestager for her remarks too.

Reinhard BÜTIKOFER,2021-10-05,EN,The future of EU-US relations (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-05-INT-2-015-0000_EN.html,"  Reinhard Bütikofer,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, let me first thank Mr Picula for the report that he drafted and for the great cooperation that he offered.
Certainly, when he started his work, the high—flying hopes that we had in the renovation, the resurgence, the reinvigorating of the transatlantic relationship were not tainted with some of the more recent disappointments. But on the other hand we should not forget – and the report says so – that also the European side made mistakes, for instance by rushing the CAI just before the end of the year and just before Biden came into office. 
Today we know that the new development, the renewing of the transatlantic relationship, needs realism and laborious efforts. It’s not going to be a sprint, rather a long and arduous cross—country run with up—and—down. 
The rhetoric sometimes sounds better than its implementation turns out to be. Like Mr Lange, I liked the rhetoric about trade that helps the working class. But if this is just a nice phrase to cover economic nationalism, that is not all that good, and I would second you by demanding that the US move substantially, according to the Airbus—Boeing model, also with regard to steel and aluminium. 
The report says we want ‘partnership in leadership’ with the US. That leadership claim also, of course, implies more responsibility. We cannot live up to that responsibility by transatlantic navel—gazing, forgetting about the rest of the world. Even though, in the conflict between democracy and authoritarianism, we know which camp we belong to, we cannot build that relationship either just as a reaction to what China does and to China’s hegemonic plans. 
We have to offer a vision to the world of a better future, including climate responsibility, infrastructure development, health, solidarity, fair and open trade and peace instead of arms races. I believe in that regard – and this is my last sentence President – that the Global Gateway initiative that President von der Leyen put on the table will have to play a major role. I hope that we can cooperate on that with the US too.

I disagree.
It was in self-defence against international terrorism, but soon our involvement went astray. We must also confess that. In overshooting self-confidence instead of helping nation-building, we try to impose nation-building, and that did not succeed. 
And then the second major mistake was that we grew tired of the burden without thinking about our strategy. And after the West had invested trillions, we were too short-sighted to make the small additional investment that would have been necessary to keep the situation relatively stable. I think the withdrawal was a mistake. 
Of course we should be able as Europeans to hold an airport for a humanitarian evacuation, but that’s not the core problem. The tools and the means are not the core problem. The perspective and the will, that’s the core problem.

We are also self—confident. We don’t believe in defeatism and declinism. We think that if Europe mobilises our positive energies, we can well stand up to the Chinese challenge. 
But we have to acknowledge – and it’s long past time – that we believed that this was just about trade. This is much more about geopolitics and on many fronts increasingly we see that the systemic rivalry is coming to the fore. I would hope we would have more opportunities for cooperation on climate policy, for instance. 
But what is it that China tells us? They say we’re not willing to be a partner on climate unless you stop criticising our atrocious human rights record with regard to Xinjiang. This is not what we are willing to accept. We are proposing positive European policies to create alternatives, like an alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. We want to stop the import of slave labour products. 
We will continue telling Ms Merkel and all the others that CAI will remain in the freezer until China changes course. We will uphold the solidarity with Lithuania and we are encouraging our leaders not to go to Beijing, not to accept invitations to the Olympics, if the Chinese human rights situation does not change.
For this policy, on which we have been united for quite a while in this House and which is a policy of pride and confidence, we would hope we get support also from the European Commission and the Member States.

Reinhard BÜTIKOFER,2021-07-08,EN,"Hong Kong, notably the case of Apple Daily",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-07-08-INT-4-096-0000_EN.html,"  Reinhard Bütikofer,  author. – Madam President, this is not the first time today that we are discussing Hong Kong in this House. It is important that we do it because we stand with Hong Kong’s fight for their freedoms and for democracy. This is not an internal affair. Upholding human rights is our common global responsibility. Systematically in Hong Kong the freedoms that were once guaranteed for 50 years to come are being dismantled. I’m very grateful that we have such a good consensus between the five big democratic groups in this House to stand against that. 
Today, we can – we must – say that free media are a thing of the past with the closure of Apple Daily. But this is just one additional step. The Legislative Council (LegCo​) has seen the Democrats evicted. The new electoral law is perverse. Universities, educators and public servants have been told that they now owe loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On the basis of spurious excuses, the traditional 4 June vigils have been denied, as have other demonstrations. Businesses like HSBC have been forced, or lured, into doing the regime’s bidding in the unjust persecution of democratic activists, and the judiciary has been put on notice that, in the future, they are expected not to apply the law, but to apply Beijing’s will. 
The European Parliament speaks up. It does so today, and it will do so in the future. But we will need some more voices from Member States’ capitals to join the chorus. Human rights stand at the centre of European foreign policy, not just for the European Parliament. That’s why we also call on political leaders to refrain from accepting invitations to the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing unless the situation changes fundamentally.

Mr Dombrovskis, you have sung well the gospel of transatlantic allegiance. You have emphasised that we have to translate intentions into action and you have promised joint leadership. 
But alas, as I listened attentively to what you said, I missed one very important topic for showing leadership. If we want to create, as Biden says, a 3B world – a ‘built back better’ world – we have to emphasise the need for an international infrastructure investment initiative, or call it a connectivity strategy, or call it a European Global Partner Europe Initiative. Whatever the name, this House has shown the way.
When we discussed the topic in January, the Commission pledged full support for the agenda. But I get the impression that the Commission still hasn’t got it. Not a single word from you on the topic, even though President Biden has emphasised it.
We have lost too much time already. We have moved forward only little by little, against internal opposition. Now there’s a chance for a breakthrough. If the Commission fails Europe on this, it is also failing Member States and Parliament at the same time. Now is the time to go big, Vice—President. Go big or go out of the way!

Israel has every right to defend itself against the indiscriminate terrorist attacks from Hamas. Europe has every obligation to strongly oppose any form of anti-Semitism that we unfortunately experience in this context again. We mourn the victims and we want a ceasefire and a stop of escalation without delay, but the reality that people would return to after cessation of hostility is in itself unsustainable. 
The region is looking into the abyss. This is a perfect storm that touches every aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It’s been a mistake to think that this issue can be put on the backburner. We need new leadership on all sides, leadership able and willing to avoid actions that undermine a peaceful future, and that includes incitement, violent attacks, terrorist acts, evictions, demolitions and settlement construction east of the 1967 line.

In this particular case we are talking about a Christian couple that is under the threat of the death penalty, but as Mr van Dalen has pointed out, in his words, the same terrible laws have been putting many other people, many other citizens belonging to different creeds and faiths also in prison, and we could just the same be talking about other individuals. 
We are not making a distinction there. We support wholeheartedly religious freedom, including the freedom not to profess a religion, and we should indeed support, as our colleague has just said, interfaith dialogue also in our own home countries to give a positive example of how to deal with religious differences, without allowing those who would want to turn that into antagonism to prevail.

Why can’t Member States show the same level of agreement? The battles over having a good Russia policy will be won or lost in the national capitals, and I would say: let’s stop saying that the EU is failing when the national capitals are failing all of us. Speaking here as a German MEP, I say it’s also the fault of my own government that the EU looks weak. How can you allow holding on to Nord Stream 2 when you see how this divides our nations and benefits Putin’s aggression? We will be weak in dealing with strongmen until our governments understand three things: EU unity must prevail; short-term economic greed doesn’t pay off; and timidity in defending our values will be costly.

Die Sanktionen, mit denen die Volksrepublik China uns in diesem Parlament bedacht hat, sind keine beiläufigen Vorgänge. Sie sind ein Angriff auf das Herz der europäischen Demokratie. Sie markieren einen neuen Höhepunkt in Chinas aggressivem Machtanspruch.
Wenn ein autoritäres Regime beansprucht, Parlamentarier, wo auch immer diese leben, zu bestrafen, weil sie von der Meinungsfreiheit Gebrauch machen und sich gegen brutale Menschenrechtsverletzungen wenden – was bleibt dann noch von den Freiheiten, die im Zentrum unseres europäischen Denkens, Fühlens und Wirkens stehen?
Das Regime von Xi Jinping benimmt sich zunehmend wie ein Schulhofschläger. Diese Herrschaften handeln, als gäbe es kein internationales Gesetz außer ihrer Willkür. Der kommunistische Parteikaiser Xi Jinping und seine Vasallen verschärfen nicht nur gegenüber uns die Gangart, sondern auch gegenüber Indien, den USA, Australien, den Philippinen, Japan, Kanada, dem Vereinigten Königreich, Taiwan und sogar gegenüber afrikanischen Ländern, die sie in Schuldenabhängigkeit getrieben haben. 
Peking handelt so, weil man dort meint, man sei dafür jetzt stark genug. Und tatsächlich sind sie sehr stark. Zu stark, als dass ein einzelnes Land aus der EU alleine standhalten könnte. Selbst die USA brauchen in der Konfrontation zwischen Demokratie und Autoritarismus Verbündete, weil sie die Herausforderungen sonst nicht bestehen.
Xi Jinping stellt die Welt vor eine Jahrhundertaufgabe. Und wir dürfen nicht so leichtfertig, nicht so selbstgefällig, nicht so blind sein, dass wir uns einbilden, es sei ohnehin klar, dass die Unfreiheit, die autoritäre Neugestaltung der Welt nicht siegen werden.
Wie wir bestehen, hängt meines Erachtens zentral an drei Fragen: Schaffen wir es, dass Demokratien sich gegenseitig solidarisch schützen und stützen? Schaffen wir es, Afrika, Südostasien und Lateinamerika eine faire Partnerschaft anzubieten, statt dass unsere Gier sie der chinesischen Hegemonie zutreibt? Schaffen wir es, unsere eigenen Länder politisch, sozial, ökonomisch und ökologisch zu erneuern, sodass unser Vorbild wieder strahlt?
Diese europäische Generation muss das hinkriegen. Die Zeit ist knapp. Die Dystopie ist keine weit entfernte Drohung. Aber wir werden ermutigt von Menschen wie Ilham Tohti, unserem Sacharow—Preisträger, die mit ihrem viel höheren Einsatz uns ein Beispiel geben für diesen Kampf.

Your statement defends the honour of our Parliament against aggressive Chinese sanctions. You have highlighted the values on which our common work is based, in particular universal human rights. These convictions have never been more important than today. We, as democrats, are united in their defence.
I want to thank all the colleagues who have expressed their solidarity with those affected. I want to thank the 281 colleagues from four different political groups from the Bundestag that have expressed their solidarity, and I want to thank those governments that have summoned the Chinese ambassadors to tell them off.
The Chinese sanctions signal this is an attack, not just on a few, but on the institution as such, on our Human Rights Subcommittee, on four of the biggest democratic groups in the Parliament and on the China Delegation.
The Chinese authorities tell us that they’re only willing to work with us as partners if we’re allowing them to define the confines of acceptable opinions. It is bad enough that freedom of opinion, freedom of speech doesn’t exist in China. We don’t want to allow them to export it. China’s attack on our institutions and fundamental values can be answered effectively if we all stick to two principles: democrats need to have each other’s back, and internationally we have to build a united front of democracies. Long live human rights!

Ich spreche zu dem Bericht über die gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik der EU. Lassen Sie mich dabei zunächst unserem Berichterstatter, dem Kollegen McAllister, herzlich danken für die außerordentlich gute und konstruktive Zusammenarbeit, die dem Ergebnis, das wir hier vor uns haben, zugrunde liegt.
Der Bericht zeigt, dass es bei uns im Parlament ein großes Maß an Übereinstimmung gibt, und das ist gut so. Ich teile ausdrücklich die drei zentralen Botschaften, von denen Herr McAllister vorhin gesprochen hat. Andererseits sehen wir in dem Bericht aber auch, dass in der heftigen Debatte um die sogenannte strategische Autonomie, die mir manchmal vorkommt wie ein Tanz ums goldene Kalb, nach wie vor keine Klarheit herrscht. Ich würde mir wünschen, wir kommen gemeinsam zu dem Ergebnis, dass es die Leitlinie sein sollte, überall dort, wo es überhaupt möglich ist, mit anderen zu kooperieren, und nur dort alleine zu marschieren, wo es unbedingt notwendig ist.
Meine Fraktion hat einige Änderungsanträge vorgelegt, etwa zur Unterstützung des UNO-Nuklearwaffenabkommens oder zur Streichung einer unnötigen Erwähnung eines unnötigen Bekenntnisses zum Mercosur-Abkommen. Ich hoffe, dass Sie diesen Änderungsanträgen zustimmen, damit wir alle dem ganzen Bericht zustimmen können.

But it is a strategy that will only grow in relevancy, an unavoidable policy framework if the EU really wants to be a valid global actor and the attention on the connectivity strategy is indeed increasing. 
If we look back, we can clearly see how much internal connectivity has been at the centre of integration policy success within our EU. Now, in a fast and fundamentally changing world in which we are trying to define the EU’s space, we need to streamline our external relations also along the fundamental ideas of connectivity thinking. Simply said, we will be more successful internationally if we remain open to the world and cooperate wherever we can to promote our values, our interests and global goods, common global goods. Not those who insist on the highest emphasis on autonomy will reach their goals best, but those who are best and most effectively connected. 
My report’s aim is to help give a second breath to the EU’s connectivity strategy by expanding it to a global scale, by following a team Europe approach, by tying it strongly to the headline goals of our Union, like the European Green Deal and digital innovation, by having clear and strong priorities and good connectivity governance and by cooperating with willing partners and contributing to connecting the connectivities.
It is important to take note of how much others are interested to cooperate with the EU on connectivity, in particular Japan, which has already struck a connectivity deal with the EU, India, that is negotiating on an accord and will put the item on the summit agenda, South Korea or the ASEAN Community, with which we have agreed in a ministerial meeting a common statement on connectivity. The EU connectivity strategy is an offer that will find many takers. Let’s not waste these opportunities. It will also be very important to actively pursue connectivity collaboration with the African Union and its members. 
I happily see intensified interest in connectivity on the part of Member States including, for instance, France, Poland and Germany, and in the business community as reflected in Business Europe’s China strategy, published one year ago. So colleagues, let us move forward together to put wheels under this car and use this great tool for implementing our shared promise to live up to our international responsibilities by attaining Weltpolitikfähigkeit as Jean Claude Juncker used to say – the ability to help shape international developments and international progress. 
In conclusion, I want to thank all the experts and interlocutors involved, including those from EU partner countries. I want to thank the Members of the Commission that have actively supported connectivity, even though it didn’t make it into the 2021 work programme, the many DGs of the Commission that have supported connectivity as well and also the External Action Service, in particular Ambassador Vlahutin. I want to thank last year’s German Presidency and this year’s Portuguese Presidency for putting emphasis behind connectivity. And I want to thank the six groups of this Parliament that have supported the connectivity report, in particular my shadow rapporteurs. It’s been fun working with you all.

Wir brauchen als EU dieses neue Instrument, weil wir in der Lage sein müssen, uns zu wehren, wenn sich andere Partner nicht an die internationalen Regeln halten und dabei dann auch noch die Kooperation bei Streitbeilegung verweigern. Die Fraktion Grüne/EFA wird deswegen diesem Ergebnis zustimmen. Sie wissen, dass wir gegen die ursprünglich in diesem Haus beschlossene Position erhebliche Vorbehalte hatten, doch im Trilog konnte ein guter Kompromiss gefunden werden.
Die Arbeit an besseren Instrumenten für die Verteidigung europäischer Werte und Interessen gegen unfaire Handelspraktiken hört damit nicht auf. Ich freue mich auf die Arbeit daran, Nachhaltigkeitskapitel in unseren Handelsverträgen effektiv durchsetzbar zu machen, oder auf die Kommissionsvorschläge gegen WTO-widrige Subventionen. Im Übrigen bin ich guter Dinge, dass mit der neuen Biden-Administration eine Lösung gefunden werden kann für die Revitalisierung der Berufungsinstanz bei Streitbeilegungsverfahren im Rahmen der Welthandelsorganisation WTO.

Die Entschließung zur Lage in Xinjiang, über die wir heute debattieren, zeigt die große Übereinstimmung der demokratischen Fraktionen, und das ist gut so.
Wo Menschenrechte mit Füßen getreten werden, zeigen wir gemeinsam Solidarität. Dass einige linksradikale Mitglieder dieses Hauses im Namen der GUE-Fraktion Anträge eingereicht haben, in denen sie sich statt mit den Opfern der Menschenrechtsverletzungen mit der autoritären KP-Propaganda aus Beijing solidarisieren, halte ich allerdings für einen Skandal. Die GUE sollte sich überlegen, wo sie eigentlich steht.
Wir wollen die Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit in Xinjiang, die gegen die Uiguren dort begangen werden, nicht nur verbal kritisieren. Wir wollen auch, dass Taten folgen. Diese Forderungen gehen vor allem an die Politik und die Wirtschaft. Um es klar zu sagen: Es muss Sanktionen geben gegen die Verantwortlichen in Xinjiang und gegen Firmen wie XPCC, die Zwangsarbeiter ausbeuten. Europas Firmen, die nicht sicherstellen können, dass sie zu Kollaborateuren des Unterdrückungsregimes werden, die nicht verhindern können, dass sie zu Kollaborateuren werden, sollen Xinjiang verlassen. 
Produkte aus uigurischer Zwangsarbeit dürfen nicht auf den EU-Markt gelangen. Beim Investitionsabkommen mit China muss die EU darauf bestehen, dass die Anti-Zwangsarbeit-Konventionen der Internationalen Arbeitsorganisation (ILO) ratifiziert werden. Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass dieses Haus zustimmt, wenn es beim Investitionsabkommen dazu keine klaren Verpflichtungen gibt.

Extraterritoriale Sanktionen stehen im Widerspruch zu den Prinzipien multilateraler Kooperation. Extraterritoriale Wirkungen von Gesetzen aus Drittstaaten gibt es aber nicht nur aus einer bestimmten Hauptstadt. China bedroht etwa die freie Kritik an seiner Politik zur Unterdrückung der Demokratiebewegung in Hongkong – egal, wo sie auf der Welt geäußert wird – mit Strafandrohung. Das sollte man nicht vergessen, wenn hier über extraterritoriale Sanktionen im Falle der Iran-Politik oder zu Nord Stream 2 diskutiert wird. 
Bei Instex brauchen wir mehr Gemeinsamkeit und mehr europäische Handlungsfähigkeit. Es ist zwar richtig, dass einige zusätzliche Länder Instex beigetreten sind, aber die Geschlossenheit der europäischen Mitgliedstaaten ist in dieser Frage leider nicht zu vermelden. Ich glaube, deswegen müssen wir uns an die eigene Nase fassen. Was Nord Stream 2 betrifft, da gibt es ja nicht nur Streit zwischen den USA und der EU, sondern auch in den eigenen Reihen. Bei Meinungsverschiedenheiten zwischen Verbündeten kann es da keine Einbahnstraße geben. 
Wir brauchen zu dieser Frage, glaube ich, eine politische Lösung, etwa zur besonderen Stabilisierung der Ukraine und zur Unterstützung der Drei-Meere-Initiative. In dem Zusammenhang kann man vielleicht eine Lösung finden.

The deal is a fair and a balanced one. We’re not naive. That’s why we have also put two guardians at the door. One is the trade enforcement mechanism that we have put in place, the other is the retaliating tariffs, which we have legally imposed on the WTO rules to signal to the US that there is a need for an agreement in the age-old Boeing-Airbus battles. As we do open a door, we also emphasise that our efforts cannot be successful if this were to be a one-way traffic. Both sides have to be willing to go through this door. We expect the new Biden Administration to understand this. 
Low-hanging fruits will be an agreement on the new WTO Director-General, new efforts – shared efforts – to reform the WTO appellate body and overcoming the Boeing-Airbus mess. We’re willing to engage in broader shared efforts: WTO reform in general, lifting unfair sanctions on EU steel and aluminium, developing effective ways of greening trade rules in order to live up to the challenge of climate change. Let us revive trade multilateralism and modernise it at the same time. 
By the way, as Mr Lange said, this deal is also an opportunity for other countries because it’s organised under the MFN (most-favoured-nation) rule. It’s a multilateral solution, it doesn’t only help Maine’s lobster industry, that is suffering under the consequences of Trump’s trade war, but it can also help Australian producers that suffer under Chinese coercive measures. We support this deal and we hope for more to come.

Auch ich begrüße die Abraham-Abkommen Israels mit einigen arabischen Ländern, denn sie konsolidieren die Sicherheit Israels.
Auf arabischer Seite handelt es sich bei diesen Abkommen um einen Kurswechsel. Früher hieß es gegenüber Israel: „Einigt euch mit den Palästinensern, dann finden auch wir zusammen“. Diese Verbindung zwischen den zwei Elementen wurde nun gekappt, aber damit verschwindet nicht die palästinensische Realität.
Israel, das nun gestärkt ist, hat jetzt zwei Möglichkeiten: entweder triumphieren und die Siedlungspolitik vorantreiben oder auf Annexion verbindlich verzichten und doch den Ausgleich suchen.
Wir Europäer werden weiter für die Zweistaatenlösung investieren. Wichtig wird dabei auch sein, die Palästinenser zu der nötigen demokratischen Erneuerung zu bewegen.

In Hong Kong, four members of the Legislative Council have been disqualified from serving in their democratically elected positions by an order from Beijing, which violates Hong Kong’s Basic Law. As a consequence, the remaining 15 legislators from the democratic camp have also resigned. 
The European Parliament, in keeping with our resolutions on Hong Kong, should raise these issues with the Chinese authorities. I call on you, Mr President, to take this up. I believe sanctions are needed to respond.
Let me close by also highlighting the fate of the 12 Hong Kong youths that are languishing in detention in Shenzhen and must be returned to Hong Kong, and by expressing solidarity with the opposition trio of Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, who are threatened with jail for organising a peaceful protest last year.

But what then? And just pretending that sending the parties back to the negotiating table would bring them anywhere closer to a solution would be foolhardy because it hasn’t happened in 30 years. So what are we doing to show our own responsibility?
It’s not just tensions as usual in the South Caucasus. There are two factors that are changing. First, the United States are dialling down their engagement in the region, even though they are one of the three co-chairs, and, second, Turkey is not de—escalating – on the contrary.
We are presently in a situation where two European neighbours – Russia and Turkey – are squaring off against each other in three distinct arenas. Both neighbours have withdrawn from the international rule of law as a principle they adhere to. 
The EU does not have a formal role in this conflict, but if the EU doesn’t take more responsibility on itself, who will help in solving the issue? That’s why I subscribe to the term that Mr Kubilius has used, the strategic responsibility of the EU.

At the same time, we’re talking about the JCPOA, and we try to hold on to that – and we should. But we are holding on to a political ruin. Even if President Biden were to be elected in November, there is scarcely a chance that the US would return to the JCPOA, if we are honest with ourselves. The JCPOA was a European initiative. We are proud of that, but that pride should be translated into a new European initiative. I think there is a new dynamic in the region, particularly with some of the deals that have already been mentioned today. The European Union should start – you should start, Mr Borrell – an initiative for a regional conference for stability and peace, and of course we need the US on board, we need the Russians on board and the Chinese and all the powers in the region. But we should not just look back, deploring what went wrong, but look forward, finding new initiatives.

Die Europäische Union hat von Anfang an in diesem Konflikt die Aspirationen der Menschen in Belarus für Demokratie und Freiheit unterstützt, aber keine eigenen geopolitischen Ziele verfolgt. 
Ich glaube, das war richtig. Das heißt aber nicht, dass andere das nicht tun. Wer das Video gesehen hat, bei dem der ehemalige Diktator, diese lächerliche Figur Lukaschenko, Putin anflehte, ihm doch zu Hilfe zu kommen, der hat erkennen können, wie dort gerade die Gewichte verschoben werden. Russland hat längst angefangen, die Gewichte zu verschieben. 
Es gibt für Belarus zwei mögliche Zukünfte: eine weißrussische und eine russische. Wir haben kein Interesse daran, dass das zweite der Fall ist. Deswegen bin ich zwar einverstanden damit, dass man sagt: Wir wollen nicht antirussisch sein. Aber gegen Putin zu sein, ist nicht antirussisch, das würde ich gerne festhalten. 
Wir müssen aber meines Erachtens darauf Wert legen, dass Lukaschenko in Zukunft nur noch eine Funktion haben kann: Weißrussland Putin zu überliefern. Deswegen müssen wir klar sagen: Eine Zukunft, einen Ausweg für Weißrussland, kann es nur ohne Lukaschenko geben.

But it’s also characterised by two novel features. 
It’s the first international crisis, since decades, in which the United States withdraws from any possible international leadership role, while China has been at the centre of this crisis, more than ever before, and this is not for the better. 
This situation reflects the ongoing continental drift in international relations. On the one hand, we have a hegemonic battle between two superpowers, on the other, international institutions are being weakened - in particular multilateral institutions - and undermined. Through the impact of the crisis, these tendencies are being accelerated.
For our EU this constitutes an imperative to step up to the plate and to shoulder our own international obligations more confidently. 
We have a mixed record. We failed when we imposed import-export bans for PPEs. We did well when the Commission organised a donors’ conference for financing vaccine research and we will lead a coalition at the WHO to require an inquiry into the origin and the spread of the pandemic.
But the challenges are many and they are huge. Battling for our values and our interests means finding allies and showing our opponents that we mean business. 
And let me end by making a remark regarding Hong Kong. I welcome the recent statement by the G7. 
Through our resolution, this EP will say that the EU will not just criticise. We want China to understand that reneging on international obligations doesn’t come free of cost. This message should be shared with Chinese leaders at the EU summit on Monday.

That’s why I welcome the White Paper that looks at ways of reining in foreign subsidies, but we also will need to strengthen our investment screening approach vis-à-vis predatory takeovers. Even though the volume of capital invested has decreased recently, the number of investments has grown, which means that investment from China is going after smaller companies that still might have a strategic role. So I think we should try to start amending our investment screening mechanism once it comes into force in October and we could learn a lesson from this.
In addition, I think in order to protect our strategic sectors we must also protect their supply chains, and there it would be interesting to learn from Japan where they’re investing into relocating in order to protect supply chains, and they do that together with ASEAN countries. We could think of doing that with Western Balkan countries and other partners too.

We mourn all the victims and we send our condolences to the families of the deceased.
We declare our high esteem for the service of the Chinese frontline medical workers under the very difficult circumstances and high risks, and I want to hail, in particular, the courage and the sacrifice of Dr Li Wenliang and others.
We welcome the fact that the EU and the Member States have shown first responses in offering support to China. We must continue to provide assistance and cooperation wherever possible. This health crisis is not over. That is why we have to make sure that there is a strong and coordinated effort within the EU and, in particular, between the Member States, and in that regard, I fully support what has been said previously by colleagues.
International cooperation more generally is of paramount importance. This is why I want to explicitly emphasise that Taiwan must be fully included in the WHO—led international efforts.
Lastly, there is a deep concern – and I am grateful to the Commissioner that she mentioned it – about the increasing number of reports of anti—Chinese or anti—Asian xenophobia in some countries, including in the EU, in the context of this crisis. This is completely unacceptable. We want to show solidarity, not allow xenophobia and racism. And in that context, we also have to battle against fake news and fearmongering.

Such a peace plan must, of course, include painful concessions, but concessions from both sides. It must include security for Israel, but it must also include a viable sovereign, contiguous state for the Palestinians living side by side with the Israelis. 
This is not what Trump is presenting to us. It’s not a fresh start, it’s a dead end. The so—called peace plan is neither about peace, because it doesn’t overcome it prolongs the conflict, nor is it a plan as a point of departure for negotiations. It’s rather a dictate. When they talk about a peace plan they are effectively pushing for annexation – and a two-state solution is different from one state plus one canton. We cannot …

Recently, we have been having an increasing number of historical debates, and it’s not easy dealing with these topics. It’s not our role and it’s not our responsibility to exonerate anybody from their historical record.
Historical truth is not at the disposal of the powerful, nor at the disposal even of parliamentary majorities, but we must defend the facts as we best know them. That also applies to Soviet aggression, to Soviet suffering and to the role of appeasement in the run—up to the Second World War. But when a victim is being turned into the perpetrator of a crime, we have to speak up, and if a wolf cries wolf, we should call it out. 
I believe that these kinds of conversations are rarely just about the past. Shifting historical blame can easily be a first step in the direction of identifying a target for more than just rhetorical aggression. Europe should beware.

And the coordination should be in the hands of the Vice—President / High Representative as it is his responsibility.
We want to defend the JCPOA but at the same time, we also must push back very clearly against Iranian aggression in other dimensions of its foreign policy. How can we keep the JCPOA alive? Not if we don’t insist on building the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) and making it functional. And the Commission should join INSTEX and put capital into INSTEX and become a partner.
And the last note that I want to strike here is this: there are many dark clouds, there is one signal of hope and that’s the engagement of Iranian citizens, and just recently also Iraqi citizens. And I think it is our duty as the EU to show effective solidarity with them.

The policy of the Chinese Communist Party towards the Uyghurs has never been liberal, but in 2014 a totalitarian turn was taken in Xinjiang that has created the worst police state that we have on the globe today. This extreme policy is even encountering some internal opposition, as we learn from the China cables, and I think that for a nation of such great cultural tradition as China, it is shameful to implement such policies.
Fighting terrorism is necessary, but it’s not an excuse for fighting people who want to think as they want, who want to speak as they want, who want to worship as they want. We strongly believe that it’s time to end the lies, to end the excuses and to end the distractions, and to close the camps. We, as Europeans, must also be active beyond just voicing critical words. That’s why this Parliament calls for the halt of exports and the tech transfer of products and services that are used to enhance cyber surveillance. This is why this Parliament asks that forced labour from internment camps must not be allowed to enter into EU-based companies’ value chains, and as has been said before, the products of forced labour must be banned from the European markets. We call on all EU-based companies to draw clear red lines. They are running a high reputational risks if they don’t implement a robust human rights due diligence system that makes sure that they’re not implicated in acts of repression.
We also need a human rights sanctions mechanism, as you have discussed with the foreign ministers in the Foreign Affairs Council, and we need that expeditiously.
Let me make a last sentence that alludes to Ilham Tohti, our Sakharov laureate. He is not allowed to see his family. He hasn’t seen his family for two years, even though Chinese law guarantees that. I think we should all insist that his family should be allowed to know where he lives and to see him.

Ich glaube, dieses Parlament hat an diesem Punkt einen großen Konsens.
Keinen Konsens haben wir allerdings von meiner Fraktion mit dem Bemühen, jetzt im Europäischen Parlament eine neue Praxis einzuführen, dass Stück für Stück Entschließungen zur Geschichte Europas verfasst werden und dann jeweils festgelegt wird, was „die Wahrheit“ über Europas Geschichte ist.

That’s in the EU’s DNA. The crisis of the WTO Appellate Body is a central part of a wider crisis of the rule of law paradigm in international trade relations.
Is it a dispute between the EU and the US? Well, unquestionably, the Trump administration has certainly caused the present impasse. But, at the origin of this escalation, I think, sits the fact that major players have been flouting WTO rules – for instance, anti—subsidy rules – with impunity and mistakes have also been made in the practice of the Appellate Body. That’s why, without reforms, the WTO is not going to be fit for purpose in the future.
The Walker proposals regarding the Appellate Body are good proposals, and they should be integrated with a wider reform of the WTO. We need not just some multilateralism, we need effective trade multilateralism.
Unfortunately, we have seen the development of a huge deal of mutual mistrust across the Atlantic in this regard. This is why I think we should send two very clear messages today from this debate: yes, we want to – and we have to – save the Appellate Body and its function, but we are also serious about reforming it. And on that basis, we call on all our partners to think again.

Ein berühmter Franzose hat einmal über eine bestimmte Art von politischen Entscheidungen gesagt: Das ist schlimmer als ein Verbrechen, das ist ein Fehler. Die Entscheidung des Rates, Nordmazedonien und Albanien die Aufnahme von Beitrittsverhandlungen zu verweigern, ist ein Fehler von historischer Dimension. Ich danke Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, Herrn Hahn oder Frau Tuppurainen und all denen von Ihnen, werte Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die klare kritische Worte dazu gefunden haben.
Trotz allem Zorn darüber, wie die EU hier zum wiederholten Mal ihr Wort gebrochen hat, trotz aller Enttäuschung über die strategische Kurzsichtigkeit, trotz aller Scham gegenüber den Menschen in Nordmazedonien und Albanien, denen der Rat die Hoffnung zunichtemacht, will ich hier nicht kritisieren. Ich will nach vorne schauen und mich direkt an Präsident Macron wenden: Herr Präsident, Sie haben sich in dieser Frage sehr isoliert, aber das Europäische Parlament ist bereit, Ihnen eine Brücke zu bauen. Wenn Sie unsere Entschließung genau lesen, stellen Sie fest, dass wir willens sind, an der von Ihnen gewünschten Reform des Beitrittsprozesses mitzuwirken. Lassen Sie uns das gemeinsam tun, aber bitte korrigieren Sie umgehend den Fehler, dass Nordmazedonien und Albanien draußen vor der Tür bleiben müssen, nur weil wir zu Hause noch nicht vollständig aufgeräumt haben.

Reinhard BÜTIKOFER,2019-10-09,EN,US tariffs on European goods following WTO's decision on the Airbus dispute (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-10-09-INT-1-194-0000_EN.html,"  Reinhard Bütikofer,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, to say that we regret the decision of the US administration without saying first that we regret the mistakes that we made years ago is hypocritical. I believe we should not get all worked up. As the Boeing case has not been adjudicated fully, it will not be possible at this moment to square it off against the Airbus case.
But let’s not get distracted from the real issue. The real issue is that we have a basic conflict between this House and the European Union on one hand and the US administration on the other and, hopefully, some of our American colleagues would be on our side of this conflict over multilateralism in the global trade order. And I believe we can use this particular experience to argue very simply: ‘the WTO works, let’s not destroy it’.

Ich möchte mich bei der finnischen Ratspräsidentschaft ausdrücklich dafür bedanken, dass Sie dieses Thema so ernst nehmen. Ich möchte mich auch bei der Kommission dafür bedanken, dass Sie sich diesem Thema so intensiv widmen. Das Europa, das schützt, muss in allererster Linie seine eigenen Werte und das heißt auch, seine Demokratie, schützen und die europäische Souveränität. Darum geht es in dieser Auseinandersetzung.
Wir müssen nicht nur in eine Richtung umsichtig und vorsichtig sein. Es gibt nicht nur aus Russland nachgewiesenermaßen Einmischungsversuche, es gibt solche auch von Herrn Erdoğan aus der Türkei. Die totalitäre Führung Chinas möchte gerne ökonomische Abhängigkeiten ausnutzen, und auch reaktionäre Kreise aus den USA haben schon versucht, sich in die europäische Demokratie zu unserem Nachteil einzumischen. Ich glaube, es ist ein Teil einer großen Auseinandersetzung zwischen einer sich entwickelnden autoritären Internationalen und dem internationalen Eintreten für Demokratie.
Damit wir das nicht verlieren, dürfen wir aber nicht nur darauf sehen, welche anderen sich bei uns einmischen wollen, sondern wir müssen selber dafür sorgen, dass in Europa keine Spaltungslinien entstehen, die durch andere ausgenützt werden können – das gehört auch zu dieser Verteidigung unserer Demokratie und Souveränität.

I came back even more convinced than before that this Parliament did the right thing when, before the summer, we declared that we stand with the people of Hong Kong.
The movement for democracy and freedom in Hong Kong is still going on, and it still deserves our continuing solidarity. ‘One country, two systems’ must not be undermined by intervention from Beijing or by imposing emergency regulations. It is not enough to withdraw the rendition bill. The people want more change. Primarily, they want an independent inquiry into the violence – in particular, police violence – and they want universal suffrage. Universal suffrage was promised to them 22 years ago in the Basic Law. The promise has not yet been kept.
Beijing must keep this promise. We, as Greens, support the fight for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. Democracy must win!

I think this is a symbolically highly relevant action by this new Parliament because we have always held that EU foreign policy would be based on the fundamental values that our Union stands for: human rights, the rule of law and democracy. When we see people rising in defence of their civic and human rights, we as Europeans must express our solidarity and this is what we do with the people of Hong Kong through this resolution. 
(Applause)

It has symbolic value that one of the first debates in this new Parliament is about the EU’s global strategy because that’s going to be at the centre of a lot of our work over the next couple of years. I look forward to a more proactive and cooperative approach not only between all the political groups in this Parliament but also between the Parliament and Member States. 
Ms Mogherini, you have given lavish praise to the EU Global Strategy so you will forgive me for adding a few criticisms. The EU Global Strategy – we read on the website of the European External Action Service – should be ‘a compass for our action in difficult times’. Well, I have a few question marks there. It’s a global strategy without geography. How can you have a global strategy without geography?
It does not really answer the question of which policies are more promising than others and should take priority. In that regard, the strategy is not strategic. It also emphasises the need for prevention, resolution and stabilisation but, when we look at the proposed Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), it’s just the opposite. The MFF proposes to slash most of the spending for these purposes and reduce it to a mere 40% of what we had before. So I think, if we take the strategy seriously, we should put our money where our mouth has been. I also believe that we should put more emphasis on climate urgency, which is completely underrated so far.
So there’s a lot that should be improved.
