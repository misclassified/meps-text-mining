Terry REINTKE,2023-12-13,EN,Review of the Spanish Presidency of the Council (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-068-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Prime Minister, dear Presidents, more than EUR 620 billion are needed for the green transition annually. Over EUR 125 billion are needed for digitalisation in Europe. Each year, EUR 384 billion are needed within the next 10 years for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Defence, education, you name it: we urgently need investment and especially after the breakthrough at the COP this morning, this is also about our global credibility. Because inaction, colleagues, will only make the future more expensive.
And, dear Prime Minister, I am not going to lie, we would have hoped – and we still hope – for a more progressive negotiation on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact in the past six months, because we both know that if we are not careful, we are sleepwalking into the next crisis, despite the fact that we should know better by now.
Europe has no time to lose. Europe can under no circumstances fall back into the failed ideology of austerity. During the corona pandemic, we have seen that our critical infrastructure is far more than tracks and roads. Debt rules that are tying us down disproportionately are a barrier for prosperity, for justice. They are a barrier for our common future. And especially as a German right now, I can tell you I know what I’m talking about. This is not for the Greens and their climate investment. This is for our economic competitiveness of this continent. Functioning infrastructure is crucial to connect this continent even closer, to build a truly integrated single market.
The US is massively investing. China is moving. The world is not waiting for us, colleagues. Just Europe is lagging behind because we have a number of ideological dinosaurs in our midst who do not understand that smart investment is needed right now.
Colleagues, this is for our citizens. This is for future-proof, good jobs. This is for a strong industry. This is for a common European future. So we count on you in this debate.
And lastly – and we all know that this is probably going to be a very noisy debate today – Prime Minister, you are very warmly welcome here because we are happy that there is a pro-European, progressive government in Spain that is going to fight with us to shape the future instead of another far-right party that wants to destroy Europe.

Terry REINTKE,2023-11-23,EN,International day for the elimination of violence against women (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-23-INT-4-011-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, not one more, ni una más, and then there is another one, and another one, and another one. Like now in Italy, where a woman was brutally murdered – the suspect her ex-partner, again. She is the 53rd case, just in Italy, just this year. 
I don't know how you feel about this, but I’m fucking furious because men believe that their own, their girlfriends, their daughters, their sisters, that they are the ones who can take decisions over their lives, their freedom and their decisions. I believe that is so deeply rooted in patriarchal power systems. Every man who cannot accept that their wife wants a divorce and chooses violence, every father who cannot accept that their daughter wants to choose freely what their job is going to be and chooses violence, every ex-partner who cannot accept that their girlfriend has a new partner and chooses violence, all of these men are part of a bigger patriarchal problem. 
Our societies have to stand up to this violence. That is why the directive against gender-based violence is so urgently needed, including, of course, as the colleagues have said, a strong and comprehensive definition of rape. And let me tell you this: since I can remember, there have been a number of Member States who continuously told us all the things that we cannot do from the European level when it comes to gender-based violence, with legal arguments that have been proven wrong. 
The debate around the Istanbul Convention clearly shows that if we in this Parliament give up the first time a Member State raises legal concerns, we will not get anywhere. But if we fight, we can make it. The EU is going to accede to the Istanbul Convention, a success, colleagues, of this Parliament and the EU is also going to adopt a strong legislation against gender-based violence. And again, it will be because of the work done in this Parliament, because we know that we owe this to the many victims of gender-based violence in Europe and all the other women living in Europe. We are going to continue this fight. We are not going to give up.

Brandanschläge auf jüdische Einrichtungen, Angriffe auf Holocaustdenkmäler und der jüdische Teil des Wiener Zentralfriedhofs ausgebrannt, und dann tausendfach antisemitischer Hass in den sozialen Medien, auf der Straße, bei Demonstrationen, in Bussen, Bahnen, in Kneipen und Wohnzimmern. Nichts von alledem ist Ausdruck einer Meinung oder ein Kommentar zum Nahostkonflikt oder gar gerechtfertigt aufgrund von derzeitigen politischen Ereignissen.
Wir stehen in Europa gerade an einem historischen Punkt. Lassen wir es zu, dass unsere offenen, vielfältigen Gesellschaften von Hass zersetzt werden? Oder, Kolleginnen und Kollegen, stellen wir uns dem entgegen? Nach dem brutalen Menschheitsverbrechen der Shoah hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten langsam wieder mehr sichtbares jüdisches Leben in Europa entwickelt. Genau dieses jüdische Leben wird gerade vielfach angegriffen. Egal von wem, egal wo und egal wann. Antisemitismus ist aufs Schärfste zu verurteilen. Hunderttausende jüdische Menschen in Europa leben in Angst.
Ich habe selber letzte Woche mit jüdischen Freundinnen und Freunden in Berlin den Schabbat gefeiert, und viele von ihnen fragen sich: Habe ich eine Zukunft in Europa angesichts der gewalttätigen Ausschreitungen der letzten Wochen oder auch der beängstigend hohen Wahlergebnisse von faschistischen Parteien? Ich möchte deshalb, dass alle demokratischen Kräfte in diesem Parlament, auf der Straße, in allen Debatten gemeinsam laut und klar sagen: Ja, Jüdinnen und Juden haben eine Zukunft in Europa! Wir stehen an eurer Seite, wir werden jüdisches Leben in Europa schützen. Wir werden offene, pluralistische Gesellschaften verteidigen, in denen nicht Angst und Hass herrschen, sondern demokratische Grundrechte, Freiheit und Toleranz – und das nicht nur an Feiertagen, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, sondern jeden Tag.
Morgen jähren sich die Novemberpogrome von 1938. In diesem Zusammenhang wird sehr häufig von „Nie wieder“ gesprochen. Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, dieses „Nie wieder“, das ist nicht irgendwann, dieses „Nie wieder“, das ist jetzt.

With a brutal killing of civilians, young people, children – many of them raped, tortured, mutilated – Hamas has shown its true face: a human-hating terror organisation that only wants death and darkness, that has nothing to offer but the hatred for Israel and ultimately wants only that – the destruction of Israel.
Make no mistake, Hamas are brutal oppressors – most of all to the Palestinians themselves. They do not represent a struggle for freedom or the legitimate claim of Palestinians to their own state. Yes, Israel has the right to protect its citizens and to defend itself. And yes, Israel must do so in compliance with international law and international humanitarian law.
Now, four weeks later, a brutal war is ongoing, and we see the humanitarian situation in Gaza badly deteriorating: civilians are dying, children are dying, people are in need of everything – food, water, medical supplies. The EU must do everything in its power to provide help to these civilians. The Israeli Government has a responsibility to avoid civilian deaths whenever possible.
We must see restraint and precision in the Israeli Government’s response to terror, both to reach the hostages and to avoid the high numbers of civilian casualties we are seeing right now. Palestinian civilians must not be collectively punished for the crimes of Hamas. We must fight for humanitarian corridors, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages and the investigation of war crimes, and for the escalation of violence to be stopped. And for that, yes, we have to work for a ceasefire, for humanitarian aid to be increased and then to reach the people in Gaza.
This conflict, colleagues, calls on all of us to rise to the occasion as Europe, as actors of peace. Let us continue to fight for peace, for humanity, for a lasting two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians both can live in peace and freedom and in security. Colleagues, let us not give in to hopelessness.

Ich denke, gerade in Zeiten wie diesen ist es immer wieder wichtig, uns daran zu erinnern, dass die Europäische Union aus erbitterten Feinden Freunde gemacht hat. Die Europäische Union hat aus einem Kontinent, der durch einen Eisernen Vorhang getrennt war, einen Kontinent der Freizügigkeit gemacht. Die Europäische Union hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten viel erreicht. Und trotzdem: Wenn wir durch die EU fahren, dann spüren wir – auch noch heute –, dass diese Vernetzung noch nicht an dem Punkt ist, an dem sie sein sollte.
Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, wir alle kennen Bahntrassen, die an der Grenze einfach abbrechen, Pipelineverbindungen, die nur national geplant werden und wo europäische Partnerinnen und Partner nicht eingebunden werden, nationale Industrie-Strategien, die gegeneinander- und nicht ineinanderlaufen – damit muss Schluss sein. Wir müssen enger zusammenarbeiten, wir müssen diesen Kontinent endlich zu Ende bauen – mit einem europaweiten Netz für Erneuerbare, mit Wasserstoffpipelines, mit Glasfasernetzen.
Denn auch Frankreich und Deutschland sind am Ende Zwerge auf dem globalen Parkett. Nur gemeinsam als Europäische Union werden wir zum Riesen. Deshalb müssen wir jetzt gemeinsam den nächsten Schritt gehen und eine europäische Infrastrukturunion bauen – und dafür brauchen wir gemeinsame europäische Investitionen. Und genau dieses Signal an die Industrie, an die Wirtschaft und an die Bürgerinnen und Bürger wünsche ich mir vom Europäischen Rat.

Dürren, Überschwemmungen, Waldbrände: Wir haben in Europa schon wieder einen Sommer der Wetterextreme hinter uns.
In Griechenland sind 80 000 Hektar Wald verbrannt, in Slowenien haben Starkregen mehr als eine halbe Milliarde Euro Schäden verursacht – über zwei Drittel des Landes waren davon betroffen. Und im Ahrtal, da waren es sogar noch viele Milliarden mehr an Schäden, die Überschwemmungen nach sich gezogen haben.
Kein Mensch kann mehr erzählen, dass Nichtstun günstiger ist oder billiger ist, als jetzt zu handeln. Extreme Wetterereignisse werden in den nächsten Jahren in Europa hunderte Milliarden Euro kosten. Hitze, Starkregen, Hagel werden dramatische Auswirkungen für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger in der Europäischen Union haben. Und schon jetzt kostet die Hitze zehntausende Menschen jedes Jahr das Leben.
Alle diese Tatsachen sind zu Genüge bekannt. Und trotzdem – trotz dieser Realität – gibt es Politiker, die erzählen, dass wir jetzt erst mal eine Pause brauchen. Eine Pause, die bedeutet, dass die Wetterereignisse in Zukunft noch extremer werden und dass wir dann noch extremere Maßnahmen treffen müssen, um gegen die Auswirkungen vorzugehen. Nein, wir brauchen keine Pause, wenn es darum geht, den Green Deal weiter voranzutreiben, denn die Klimakrise, die Auswirkungen der Klimakrise, die macht auch keine Pause.
Deshalb müssen wir jetzt handeln. Und das ist nicht nur rational, sondern das ist auch politische Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Denn alles andere wäre Realitätsverweigerung. Wenn es schwierig wird zu sagen: „Mit Nichtstun werden wir schon irgendwie durchkommen“, obwohl die Realität doch ganz klar zeigt, dass es genau anders ist. Das ist brandgefährlich und verantwortungslos. Deshalb müssen wir, so anstrengend es sein mag, weitermachen, denn der Green Deal ist kein Sprint, sondern ein Marathon.
Wir müssen als Europäische Union mehr tun, um die Bürgerinnen und Bürger bei der Bewältigung von Klimafolgen zu unterstützen. Die Europäische Union ist auf Solidarität aufgebaut, und für einige Menschen mag es viel klingen, wenn wir gemeinsam als Europäische Union Milliarden Euro in den Katastrophenschutz stecken. Aber wenn wir uns anschauen, welche massiven Schäden – auch finanzieller Art – Katastrophen in der Europäischen Union anrichten, dann ist das gut investiertes Geld.

Herr Weber! Ich muss ganz ehrlich sagen, ich bin ziemlich enttäuscht, denn es gab eine sachliche Debatte zu diesem Thema. Es gab Sitzungen der Schattenberichterstatter zum NRL, aus denen sich die EVP leider zurückgezogen hat. Es gab gestern eine lange Debatte, in der wir hier in diesem Plenum über diesen Gesetzesentwurf diskutiert haben. Wissen Sie, wer nicht da war? Sie! Obwohl Sie sehr häufig adressiert worden sind in dieser Debatte, auch zum Thema Fake News, auch zu der Frage, wie sich die EVP positioniert hat.
Deswegen lassen Sie uns diese Debatte führen. Aber lassen Sie uns dann darüber reden, wenn es auf der Tagesordnung steht und wenn die Kolleginnen und Kollegen auch da sind, um darauf einzugehen, was Sie hier gesagt haben.
And I still believe what is happening in Ukraine and what was happening at the Council is of the utmost importance, because the destruction of Ukraine’s Kakhovka Dam constitutes a new level of aggression in Putin’s criminal war of aggression. This calculated act of terrorism put thousands of people at risk. The floods that were caused were an ecological catastrophe as tons of harmful substances polluted the surrounding area. And the destruction of this dam endangered also the nearby nuclear power plant of Zaporizhzhia. 
This is a new dimension in which we find ourselves, colleagues. Russia is misusing a civilian dam located near to a nuclear power plant as a weapon of war. And I think that the European Union and the heads of state of the European Union have to be clear and take a clear stance to stop Russia on this deadly path. 
But also efforts must now focus on Ukraine’s reconstruction. We welcome the new facility that has been created for this purpose to mobilise more funds. But we don’t need just any money, we need to rebuild Ukraine in a sustainable and renewable way. We need a green deal for Ukraine to bring more prosperity to the country after the horrors of war and a better environment for the people of Ukraine. 
And one last issue, and I think it has become obvious again at the EUCO meeting, we need a coherent and coordinated strategy on China from the heads of states and governments of the European Union. We welcome the clear sentences on the Taiwan Strait. But other than that, the agreement actually lacks clarity on this strategy, which is very urgently needed. So we appeal to the Member States: do what is necessary, act united and act decisively.

We have to restore our nature, not in a distant future, not when the EPP has got its act together – we have to act now: to preserve nature, the basis of our agriculture, the basis of our economic prosperity; to keep the climate targets, because 10% out of the 55% that we agreed to reduce our emissions by before 2030 are nature-based climate action; to keep our competitiveness to the self-declared business groups in this Parliament. You heard the appeal by major companies like Unilever or Ikea to let the Nature Restoration Law pass.
So dear EPP colleagues, many of your parties are actually based on Christian values, centred on the preservation of creation. Please follow your inner conviction and not what your group leader is telling you and vote tomorrow in favour of the Nature Restoration Law.
Dear Renew colleagues, the Nature Restoration Law is about freedom. The destruction of biodiversity already today is limiting our options and it is going to get worse in the future. Preserve our freedom and vote in favour of the Nature Restoration Law tomorrow.
But colleagues, we also all know that this law has become much more than just itself in the past month. It has become a symbol, a symbol of the Green Deal, a symbol of constructive decision-making in this Parliament. And it has unfortunately become a symbol of political games within the EPP on which strategy they want to go for for 2024. Mr Weber, who is unfortunately not here right now, we can clearly see what your strategy is: going against your own Commission President.
All of this, to me, is a sign of a deep identity crisis within the EPP, a shift in decision—making here in this Parliament, and for me a very dangerous development, especially as far-right parties, groups and movements are gaining ground across Europe.
Colleagues, let us vote tomorrow in favour of the Nature Restoration Law to show that constructive decision-making in this Parliament is still possible. To show that we stand behind the Green Deal and yes, also to restore and protect our nature.

They have names, they have stories, and they have hope to find shelter in the European Union. And yes, the current the current asylum system in the European Union is dysfunctional and needs reform. I think almost everybody agrees on that. And yes, finding political agreement in the context of a mostly toxic debate that is driven by fears rather than facts is very difficult. 
But colleagues, right now, the whole story that still far too many politicians are selling to people in Europe about migration and asylum is simply not working. And that story is tougher rules, less refugees, more walls, less refugees, more fences, less refugees. I get that this is an easy sell and that a lot of politicians find it easier not to get into the difficult, complex reality of things. But these lines are simply wrong and there will be no breakthroughs, no improvements of the situation, but only frustration and more hardship at our external borders. 
Right now, there are a number of reasons why the number of refugees in the European Union is high. Reason number one: Vladimir Putin, and I’m not even talking about Ukraine because Ukraine was not the first country where Putin’s bombs led to millions of people having to flee. And if we don’t stand up to him, colleagues, it will not be the last. 
Reason number two: climate change. The number of climate refugees will increase the more extreme the impact of climate change will become. So instead of falling back into climate denial, let us take the necessary steps of mitigation and adaptation now, because now is the time we have to act. 
Reason number three: autocrats that are waging wars against their neighbours and their own citizens, torturing them, imprisoning them, executing them just because they want to live in freedom. Instead of making deals with these autocrats, we should actually support the people in the streets who are fighting for democracy. 
The fundamental right to asylum is not only a right but a lesson from our own history. Let us not gamble it away on fake simplistic promises that might work in the next election campaign, but not in the long run. But let us fight and also struggle with the position that the Council has found now for a real, sustainable solution that combines humanity and order. This Parliament, as a beacon of peace and human rights, owes the world at least that. 
But let us also talk about crucial decision making that is ongoing on the Green Deal, and especially let us talk about finding compromise with the EPP, who have recently walked out of the democratic negotiation of a crucial piece of legislation, the Nature Restoration Law. This piece of legislation is not only important to meet the Paris goals and to fight against biodiversity loss. Even if you don’t care about any of that, it is crucial to act now in order to keep up our economic competitiveness in the future. Because farmers need healthy soils, they need pollinators, they need clean water. Agriculture needs nature. That is why restoring nature is a precondition for a sustainable economic prosperity and for food security.
And if you think it is a Green co-chair who is saying this, don’t listen to me, listen to big corporations that have recently intervened in the debate. They say with these actions, like the Nature Restoration Law, the European Union would create a level playing field for all businesses in Europe and ensure forward-thinking companies are rewarded for their actions to hold and reverse nature loss. The EU would become a more competitive, resilient and sustainable economy. This law is about nature ... (President interrupted speaker) ... in the future and the EU ... (President interrupted speaker) ... EPP should come back to the negotiation table.

She died three weeks ago of a septic shock after being denied abortion care in a Polish hospital. She is not the first woman who has died since the introduction of the brutal anti-abortion legislation. Tragic stories, you could say, but what does this have to do with the debate on rule of law in Poland? Actually, it has to do a lot with the rule of law, because what we are experiencing right now is just another step to tighten the grip of authoritarian rule in Poland. After the politicisation of the judiciary, the takeover of public media, attacking minorities, restriction of fundamental rights, including access to life-saving abortion care. 
Now the next attacks on the rule of law and democratic standards are underway in Poland. By meddling with electoral law and trying to intimidate the democratic opposition with an investigative committee that can even prevent candidates from taking up office. Colleagues, when we look around the world right now, we witness a more and more autocratic backlash against democracy, against freedom, and against a rules-based world order. Let us make sure that the European Union, with united effort stands up to this. And with half a million people in the streets of Warsaw last Sunday, I am confident that Polish citizens are at our side in this struggle, not only in Poland but across the European Union, led us, as all democratic parties work together to prevent an authoritarian shift. This is not about left or right. This is about protecting our democracy together. So let us stand up for rule of law and democracy in Poland and all over the European Union together.

We can see – and this is not an isolated event – that climate change is nothing happening in the distant future anymore; it is something that is happening now –with extreme weather events, with droughts, with floods, with forest fires. We in this Parliament should debate what needs to be done now, what the necessary steps are to show solidarity with people in Italy, but also what the long term implications are, so that we avoid situations like this from happening again.

Colleagues, I don't know how you feel about it, but I think we have wasted enough time because the demands in this resolution are very similar to the ones that we already adopted six years ago. There are demands to reform and to fight against sexual harassment here in the European Parliament, like, for example, mandatory harassment training, where right now we have a situation where not even half of the members of this parliament have done these harassment trainings, external audits to improve the situation, with independent experts looking at what we can do for a zero-tolerance policy, and a reform of the obviously dysfunctional complaints structures that we have here in the European Parliament. If I'm being honest, I really start losing patience. We have to stop only talking and adopting resolutions and we have to start acting.

Herr Bundeskanzler, Sie kommen zu einem denkbar guten Zeitpunkt hier nach Straßburg, denn es gibt nach den letzten Monaten, ehrlich gesagt, einiges zu kitten für den Mann mit der Richtlinienkompetenz aus Berlin. Die Ampelkoalition ist ja bekanntlich angetreten mit einem Anspruch des Aufbruchs, der Erneuerung und des Fortschritts. Ihre Partei hat Sie selbst im Wahlkampf als einen Klimakanzler plakatiert, als einen, der es anpackt, als einen, der liefert. Ehrlich gesagt, dieses Versprechen des Aufbruchs hat auch hier in Europa vielen imponiert: Endlich ein Bundeskanzler, der etwas verändern will nach Jahren des Stillstands, nach Jahren des German vote endlich jemand mit einer Agenda.
Aber ich muss ganz ehrlich sagen, Herr Bundeskanzler, das Bild von Ihnen als Kanzler, der liefert, das ist in den letzten Monaten leider verblasst.
Und auch das des Anspruchs, den einige in dieser Koalition an die Rolle Deutschlands in Europa stellen, und, so scheint es – und das muss ich so offen sagen – manchmal auch das Ihrige. Denn Sie lassen laufen, statt sich klar zu positionieren. Wenn etwa die FDP die Glaubwürdigkeit Deutschlands aufs Spiel setzt und den Ruf der deutschen Bundesregierung als verlässlichen Partner in Europa anknackst, und das bei einem zentralen klimapolitischen Projekt der Europäischen Union, dem Aus des Verbrennungsmotors, einem Herzstück des Pakets „Fit für 55“, was macht da der deutsche Bundeskanzler? Erst sagt er gar nichts, und dann stellt er sich auch noch hinter den Koalitionspartner, der gerade das Vertrauen der europäischen Partner verspielt.
Oder ein anderes Beispiel: Richtigerweise, Herr Bundeskanzler, sind Sie mit der Zeitenwende angetreten, was die Ukraine angeht. Aber dann wirkt es an ganz vielen Stellen hier in Brüssel und Straßburg und in vielen Hauptstädten der Europäischen Union häufig so, als müsste man Ihnen jede konkrete Maßnahme mühsam abringen. Das ist in einer Situation, wo Solidarität, wo Handlungsfähigkeit gefragt war, nicht die Art und Weise, wie ein deutscher Bundeskanzler sich positionieren sollte.
Ich könnte diese Liste fortsetzen, aber dafür sind wir nicht hier. Ich bin hier, Herr Bundeskanzler, weil ich an Sie appellieren möchte. Ich möchte an Sie appellieren, weil ich Sie kämpfen sehen will für Europa, weil wir einen deutschen Bundeskanzler brauchen, der europäisch denkt und vorangeht. Ich wünsche mir zum Beispiel einen Kanzler, der aus den Fehlern seiner eigenen Partei gegenüber Russland gelernt hat und nicht genau die gleichen Töne gegenüber China anschlägt, …
(Beifall)
… der Menschenrechte in einer klugen gemeinsamen europäischen Strategie gegenüber China nach vorne stellt und auch die nötigen Konsequenzen für die industrielle und wirtschaftliche Stärke der Europäischen Union zieht. Ich wünsche mir einen Kanzler, der weiß, dass dieser Kontinent nur dann wettbewerbsfähig ist, wenn er zusammenhält und wenn er bei der grünen Transformation endlich vorangeht und nicht länger hinterherhinkt.
Auch, Herr Bundeskanzler, wenn das mal Geld kostet. Und ja, mir ist klar, wer Ihr Finanzminister ist. Und trotzdem: Ich wünsche mir einen Bundeskanzler, der die Deutschen davon überzeugt, dass der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt, so, wie er gerade ist, genau diese wichtigen Zukunftsinvestitionen ausbremst. Ich wünsche mir einen Bundeskanzler, der sagt – und Sie haben das selber erwähnt: Ich komme aus einer Stadt, die reich und mächtig geworden ist, nicht weil sie sich abgeschottet hat, sondern weil sie sich geöffnet hat für die Welt. Deshalb stelle ich mich ganz klar gegen eine Asylpolitik, die eine Festung Europa bauen will. So einen Bundeskanzler wünsche ich mir.
Vor 73 Jahren hat Robert Schuman in einer wegweisenden Rede die Geschichte dieses Kontinents für immer verändert. Er hat zu einer Zeit, als der Terror von Nazideutschland Tod und Elend gebracht hatte und es wahrscheinlich kaum Menschen in Europa gab, die in den letzten Jahren keine geliebten Menschen verloren hatten, ein Bild von Frieden, von Gemeinsamkeit und einer besseren Zukunft gezeichnet. Ich wünsche mir heute einen Kanzler, der mit so einer Weitsicht vorangeht.
Ja, Herr Bundeskanzler, Sie wollen ja das Richtige: die Erweiterung, die Handlungsfähigkeit, die Beendigung der Einstimmigkeit im Europäischen Rat. Sie werben für einen Konvent, aber bleiben Sie da nicht im Ungefähren, sondern gehen Sie gemeinsam mit diesem Parlament voran! Wir haben vorgeschlagen, einen europäischen Konvent zu starten. Ich bin mir sicher: Wenn Sie mit ganzer Kraft im Rat dafür werben, dann können wir dafür eine Mehrheit bekommen und noch vor der Europawahl einen europäischen Konvent einberufen.

Yesterday he had a pretty bad day because he had a cough but, in general, he’s a really happy and lively child. When he’s going to be my age, 35, and that is going to be in 2056, the risk is high that he will find himself in a world that has become hostile to humans: increasing floods, droughts, forest fires, conflicts over resources, devastated lands, infertile soils, millions and millions of people having to flee.
In 2056, our planet may be on the path of no return for humanity or it may not. When you read the IPCC report, yes, there is much reason to panic. But there is also reason for hope – because it shows that we can make a difference, that we can still turn this around. The world that my nephew will live in will be shaped by the decisions that we take today. Everybody in this plenary is in a position of power, and I am convinced that everybody in this plenary loves someone who was born in the last 10 years. We have to use this power. We have to use the trust that was put in us and give a future not only for ourselves but also for the generations to come.
And if I may, I think, when we speak about this this topic in a more abstract way, we have a lot of unity. The disunity comes when we speak about concrete actions, but at the end of the day, it is not abstract debates about climate change that are going to change the world, but concrete actions, so let us take concrete actions, colleagues.

Wenn ich das sagen darf: Ich bin ein bisschen überrascht, dass die liberale Fraktion keinen Redner oder keine Rednerin in dieser Debatte aufgestellt hat, weil ich eigentlich finde, dass wir hier über Dinge reden, die fraktionsübergreifend von diesem Parlament gefordert werden sollten. Denn es geht in der Tat um Rechtsdurchsetzung. Es geht darum, dass alle sich an Regeln halten müssen. LKW—Fahrer, die wochenlang keinen Lohn bekommen, in Streik treten, von Gewerkschaften in der Einforderung ihrer Rechte unterstützt werden und als Antwort dann von brutalen Schlägertrupps bedroht werden, geschickt von der Spedition, die ihnen den Lohn vorenthält.
Kolleginnen und Kollegen, wir müssen der Realität ins Auge blicken. Es gibt Speditionen in der Europäischen Union, die die Ausbeutung ihrer Fahrerinnen und Fahrer zu ihrem Geschäftsmodell gemacht haben. Und erstens – das haben die Kolleginnen und Kollegen schon gesagt: Das sind keine seltenen Ausnahmen. Ausbeutung im Transportsektor ist an der Tagesordnung. Und hier im Europäischen Parlament haben wir immer wieder Berichte von Fahrerinnen und Fahrern gehört, die gesagt haben, dass sie monatelang nicht nach Hause gehen konnten, dass sie zum Teil zur Geburt der eigenen Kinder nicht zu Hause sein konnten, dass sie von unfassbaren sanitären Umständen betroffen waren, dass Lohn zurückgehalten wurde und so weiter und so fort.
Und lange Zeit ist in der Tat nichts oder viel zu wenig passiert. Und erst durch die Unterstützung der Gewerkschaften – gerade von Projekten wie Faire Mobilität – kommen diese Missstände ans Tageslicht und werden die Fahrer unterstützt, sich gegen solchen Rechtsbruch zu wehren. Denn was da passiert, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, das ist nicht irgendeine Form von Marktwirtschaft. Was da passiert, ist einfach nur kriminell.
Und zweitens: Diese Speditionen fahren nicht für no name. Ikea, DHL und VW haben in diesem Fall Aufträge an die entsprechende Firma gegeben. Und auch das muss sich ändern. Aber auch die Politik muss endlich handeln, und wir brauchen in der Tat viel engmaschigere Kontrollen, auch von der Europäischen Arbeitsbehörde. Denn die Europäische Union kann bei diesen massiven Missständen nicht die Augen verschließen.
Aber ja, selbst die besten Gesetze bringen nichts, wenn sie nicht durchgesetzt werden. Und offensichtlich fühlen sich viele Unternehmen immer noch ziemlich sicher in dem, was sie da tun – auch wenn es Rechtsbrüche sind –, weil sie nicht kontrolliert und sanktioniert werden. Und das ist nicht nur ein Problem für die betroffenen Fahrer, sondern für die gesamte Branche und am Ende für uns alle. Deswegen, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen: Unser Kampf gegen Ausbeutung muss weitergehen. Volle Solidarität mit den Fahrern. Das Europäische Parlament steht an eurer Seite.

Terry REINTKE,2023-03-29,EN,Formal sitting - Ceremony on the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-29-INT-1-014-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, today we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement came after long conflict. 3 500 people have lost their lives in decades marked by violence, by insecurity and by hatred. This agreement is a symbol of committed peace-building, and 25 years later we acknowledge the hard work, the political will and the commitment that was put into making it happen by so many people. 
Colleagues, we all know that Brexit has shaken the political situation in Northern Ireland and made many of the questions that still need resolving more difficult, and this is not going to go away for a while. But, with the Windsor Framework, the European Union and the UK have recently shown that constructive negotiations based on trust and understanding have a good outcome even in difficult situations. We will continue to do everything in our power to secure peace in Northern Ireland and to support the Good Friday Agreement. 
Let’s also never forget, peace is not only the absence of armed conflict. Safeguarding fundamental rights of all citizens is a crucial part of a sustainable peace, and that is why the European Convention on Human Rights has played such an important role for peace—building in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. That is why defending the European Convention on Human Rights is absolutely crucial, especially now that we see it being put under attack. 
Colleagues, the European Union was built on promoting peace. On the ruins of violent conflict, millions of people came together. So let us not only remember the great effort it took to achieve peace and the Good Friday Agreement, but let’s build on this spirit for the future – for a peaceful, a just and a democratic Ireland, United Kingdom and Europe built on understanding, on trust and on human rights.

Yet in the last weeks, we witnessed yet another attack on rainbow families in Europe, this time in Italy. 
The practice to recognise certificates of same-sex parents has been restricted by the Interior Ministry and actually one person who is affected by this is sitting in the tribune, Giuseppe Sala, the Mayor of Milan. It’s great that you are here. We stand with you defending the LGBTI community. 
I want to be crystal clear: we are not surprised by these attacks but, still, we are outraged. And we will stand in solidarity with the community in Italy and everywhere in Europe. And this is why it is absolutely important that we have this debate right now, because for this Parliament, all EU citizens and all families are worth the same and deserve fundamental rights. 
And if I may say, Madam President, we have, together with other groups, come up with a compromise for the title. The title would now read ‘The rights of children in rainbow families and same-sex parents, in particular in Italy’, to be discussed tonight with an extended session by one hour and to be voted by RCV.

We are celebrating women in the fight for their rights. We are celebrating women in their fight against patriarchy.
But let me say this: women are for long already not only carrying the fight for women’s rights. They are carrying across the globe the fight for democracy and freedom – values that the European Union is founded on. If we look at Iran, if we look at Afghanistan, if we look at Argentina, there are brave women who are fighting for what we hold dear and they are a source of inspiration to all of us.
One of the women that we should be celebrating today, and for International Women’s Day, is Justyna Wydrzyńska, not only because she has shown bravery and commitment, but because she has helped others. She has helped people in need. She supported women who needed access to abortion in a country like Poland, where the right and the access to abortion has been heavily restricted over the past years.
This form of compassion and solidarity is what makes our society strong. She has stood up for our values and very concretely provided support. But instead of celebrating her, she is being criminalised. She was convicted to eight months of community service yesterday for caring for others, for defending our rights.
Colleagues, we cannot stay silent on this – full solidarity to Justyna and all the women in Poland and elsewhere in the world who are standing up for their rights, who are standing up for care and solidarity. I do not want to live in a Europe where women who are helping other women are being criminalised. So let us take this day and let us take action together. Let us put the right to abortion into the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights. Women in Europe deserve it. Let us be a beacon of hope and inspiration for all women across the globe.

Terry REINTKE,2023-03-14,EN,"This is Europe - Debate with the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda (debate)",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-14-INT-2-065-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, first of all I wish to welcome the President to the European Parliament and, most importantly – even if we are a bit late – to say ‘Happy Independence Restoration Day’ to Lithuania, of course.
More than anything, colleagues, the full—scale invasion of Ukraine has confirmed the need for European unity. And it is true that only together, as Europeans, can we stand up against the brutal imperialism of the Russian regime. We have shown here in the European Parliament that we stand for unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, be it financial, humanitarian, or military support, paving the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. 
But of course, and you have mentioned it, Mr President, we need full energy independence of the brutal Russian regime. For too long politicians also, and especially from my home country, Germany, have ignored the alert for from our eastern neighbours, like, for example, Lithuania, and now we are paying a high price for this. 
But colleagues, one thing has to be understood. Simply switching from one energy dependency on one dictatorship to another will not solve any of our problems. Nor does the shift from one fossil fuel dependency to another non-renewable energy source. The only sustainable answer that will prevent us from having the exact same problem that we have been facing in the last year again, in two, five or ten years is to make our energy consumption 100% renewable. That is possible and we have no time to lose. No country in the European Union will manage this alone. Only a strong European Green Deal can make that possible. 
You are absolutely right. The Green Deal for long already has not only been a measure that we need to protect our climate or to stimulate our economy, it has become the most crucial measure also for strong security in the European continent. But, Mr President, the fight against authoritarianism does not only happen, unfortunately, outside of the European Union. We also have to stay vigilant inside because we can see attempts of undermining our democracy, of undermining separation of powers, rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union, brutal attacks on press freedom and journalists. 
We cannot stay silent in the European Union on these developments because the EU is not only a community of trade – we share fundamental values. If we want the EU to be strong and true to its own values, we have to protect all our citizens from these attacks, no matter whether they are from Lithuania or Portugal, no matter their gender, their skin colour or their sexual orientation. Because safeguarding freedom and human dignity means safeguarding freedom and human dignity for all.

It is good news for the people in Northern Ireland. It is good news for the people in the whole of the UK and it is good news for the people in the European Union.
And it shines a light on the value of trustful cooperation, something that was badly missing from the negotiations between the EU and the UK, at least from some people in the past. And in the aftermath of the announcement of the agreement, Rishi Sunak actually praised the unique position of Northern Ireland being part of the UK’s and the EU’s market.
And I can only congratulate him for the clarity and insightfulness of his words, because yes, indeed, being part of the EU single market makes you strong. It means more prosperity, it means less red tape and it means more freedom. And, if you ask me, if we are being honest, the whole of the UK should actually benefit from these advantages and not only Northern Ireland.
Colleagues, in a world where we see aggressive autocrats trying to take more power, it is important that democracies work together, and this agreement is a step into the right direction for that.

Ein Jahr nach der brutalen Eskalation des Krieges in der Ukraine ist absolut klar: Wir stehen fest an der Seite des angegriffenen demokratischen Staates Ukraine, und unsere Unterstützung – sei sie finanziell, sei sie politisch, oder sei sie militärisch – ist absolut sicher, auch wenn wir jetzt und gerade aus dem Mitgliedstaat, aus dem ich komme, immer wieder Stimmen hören, die versuchen, krude Narrative in diese Debatte zu streuen, um die öffentliche Diskussion zu zermürben.
Deshalb will ich einige Sachen mal klarstellen: Nicht Waffenlieferungen an die Ukraine verlängern diesen Krieg – Wladimir Putin tut das. Waffenlieferungen schützen die Ukraine vor ihrer Auslöschung und Millionen Menschen in der Ukraine vor Gewalt und Besatzung. Und genau wie der Hohe Repräsentant gesagt hat, Waffenlieferungen schließen absolut keine Verhandlungen aus. Ein Land in seiner Selbstverteidigung zu unterstützen bedeutet nicht, keine Diplomatie mehr zu wollen. Es bedeutet, internationales Recht zu schützen.
Und drittens – und ich finde es wichtig, das in der Debatte sehr klar zu sagen: Es wird kein Zurück zum Status quo ante geben, nicht mit diesem Russland. Die gesamte Sicherheitslage in Europa hat sich verändert, und eine neue Welt braucht neue Antworten und nicht die alte Leier.
Und deshalb: Anstatt sich von Faschos für Unterschriftensammlungen beklatschen zu lassen, wäre es jetzt an der Zeit – gerade an all die, auch aus Deutschland, die diese alte Leier von vor dem 24. Februar 2022 weiter singen –, endlich mal nach Riga, nach Warschau oder nach Helsinki zu fahren und nicht andere zu belehren, sondern da zuzuhören und endlich zu sehen, dass wir in einer neuen Welt weiterhin klar an der Seite der Ukraine stehen müssen.

Terry REINTKE,2023-02-01,EN,"Preparation of the Special European Council meeting of February, in particular the need to develop sustainable solutions in the area of asylum and migration (debate)",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-01-INT-1-041-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, colleagues, ahead of the EUCO meeting next week, we are facing a crucial moment for the future of our economy and our competitiveness. But let me be clear, it is not with senseless deregulation, dismantling workers’ rights or environmental standards, or this so-called moratorium on regulation that we can make the European Union strong and competitive for the 21st century. 
Our competitiveness will depend on how well we can lead the Green transformation globally, supporting green industries, being the first when it comes to climate—friendly and environmentally—friendly technologies. Yes, for that we will actually need green and sustainable regulation to give planning security to our companies and, yes, for setting the scene globally to move ahead with the green transformation. Indeed, we will need money for that. We will not need random investment, but we will need very targeted green investment in order to make this possible. 
I’ve read the letter that the Commission President sent to the Member States on migration and let me be honest, to me, it sounded – in a very technocratic and depoliticised language – like a plan to create a Fortress Europe. Not once was there was a mention of human rights, not once there was a mention of the suffering of those who are trying to find shelter in the European Union, and not once there was a mention of international law – international law that binds the European Union when it comes to asylum. But also, in the framing, we are talking about migration here – and migration is not only about asylum and returns. This whole initiative can only work if we look at migration in its entirety. 
I negotiated recently a coalition agreement between the Conservative Party and the Greens in North Rhine-Westphalia, and I can tell you what the number one concern of the SMEs, of the care homes and the citizens was: it was the question of how we can attract trained workers, trained labour in order to fit the shortages in our labour market. If we are not looking at this, if we are not looking at what our citizens need, then we are falling short of what we actually need to address. 
Don’t get me wrong. We all want orderly border management. We want legal provisions to be applied, but orderly border management, Mr Weber, also applies to border guards and we have seen in the past that there were illegal pushbacks. We have seen that this has been covered up. We have seen that there was no punishment for this. We have seen that there was no accountability. This, colleagues, is definitely unacceptable. 
The European Union received the Nobel Peace Prize not for building walls, not for encircling this continent in fences, not for pushing back boats of people who are looking for shelter. We received the Nobel Peace Prize because this Union stands for a promise, and, for me, the responsibility and the duty that we have learned from the horrors of the past – from nationalist devastations, but also from the suffering that this continent has brought to the world; a promise that we will be a beacon of human rights and of shared values. This, Commission President, does not end at how we behave at our external borders.

In 2020 in Hanau, nine people were killed by a far—right terrorist. In 2022 in Bratislava, two queer people were shot coming out of a gay bar by a right—wing extremist. This list is far from exhaustive, and you all know it; hundreds of people have been killed by far—right extremists over the past years.
In December last year, security forces conducted one of the biggest anti—terror investigations in German history against an alleged far—right terror network trying to overthrow the constitutional order in Germany. Among the suspects, and I want to say this clearly, there was a member of the far right party AfD, and not just any member, but a former Member of the German Parliament.
These people planned to overthrow the democratic constitutional order in Germany. They are especially dangerous, because many of them have a lot of money, they have resources, and they have very good links to police and security forces, as well as to the justice system.
Let me be clear, colleagues, in the twenties and thirties of the last century, many conservatives and liberals in Germany made a fatal mistake. They believed that they could keep the far—right, the violence and the hatred for democracy, in check. They failed. You all know the outcome of this. We cannot let the same mistake happen again.
I must say that also here in this House, I see very dangerous tendencies to normalise the far—right, not least today, where a far—right candidate also received votes from democratic groups. Colleagues, we have to stand up to this far-right threat together, as democrats. These people are not playing. They are not making jokes. They mean it when they say that they want to overthrow our constitutional democratic order. We have to stop them.

But I think it’s also important that we already take the necessary steps that can be taken now, now. And I want to thank the President for coming forward with a proposal in this direction. I believe it is a good starting point, but some of the points will need to be added and maybe strengthened and sharpened a little bit.
First of all, and I think that this is really important, we owe it to the citizens to bring our deliberations in this House to light. And that is why we will need a special committee with a very clear mandate to make recommendations of what is necessary to fight against corruption and for integrity and transparency in this House.
Secondly, this institution needs better whistle—blower protection because people who bring misconduct and wrongdoing to light need to be protected and not punished.
Thirdly, we need a stronger and mandatory transparency register. This is also part of the proposal, but I believe that we have to bring transparency by including also third-country representatives and by enforcing the rules that we already have on transparency, better. We need to make the register mandatory while at the same time ensuring that we do not put people at risk like, for example, human rights defenders, by not granting reasoned and limited exceptions.
We have a big majority in this House supporting the establishment of an ethics body. But let us not wait until the Commission comes forward, let us already nominate our negotiators now so that the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement can start as soon as possible.
And fifth, we have to be better in enforcing rules, and clearer defined sanctions will play a very important role in order to make that possible. For all this, we will need clear deadlines and very understandable procedures. And colleagues, I think many of you know, I really love this House, and it is one of the greatest achievements that we have come forward with in the history of the European Union, that we come together here as directly elected representatives of EU citizens. And I think because of this, because we love this House and because we want to protect it, we need to do everything possible right now.

But for us, it will be very important also to focus on integrity and transparency measures, so to have that definitely in the title.

Ich glaube, wir sind alle immer noch entsetzt über das, was da am Wochenende ans Tageslicht gekommen ist. Ich will mal meinen Vater zitieren, der gesagt hat: „Was für eine verdammte Scheiße, was sie da abgezogen haben.“ Ich glaube, das ist ein Zitat, das zeigt, wieviel Vertrauen zerbrochen ist.
Vertrauen lässt sich nur wieder aufbauen, wenn wir jetzt als Europäisches Parlament handeln. Deshalb werden wir sehr klar sein müssen, auch in der Entschließung, die wir verabschieden, was die Verurteilung der Taten angeht, was die Aufklärung angeht und was bessere Prävention angeht, und eine absolut kristallklare Reaktion auf Korruption und Fehlverhalten ist da absolut zentral.
Den ersten Schritt sind wir heute gegangen, indem wir Eva Kaili als Vizepräsidentin des Parlaments abgesetzt haben. Korruption muss weitgehende Konsequenzen haben. Punkt. Keine Diskussion.
Zweitens: Wir brauchen volle Aufklärung, einen Untersuchungsausschuss und natürlich volle Kooperation mit den belgischen Behörden. Denn wenn sich eins gezeigt hat, ist das, dass es eine fähige und unabhängige Staatsanwaltschaft in Belgien gibt.
Drittens – und ich glaube, das ist ein sehr wichtiger Teil dieser Aufarbeitung – weitergehende Maßnahmen für bessere Prävention. Ja, es gibt Dinge, die auch mit besseren Transparenzregeln nicht vollends zu verhindern sein werden. Aber trotzdem ist es wichtig, dass wir jetzt auf volle Transparenz setzen, zum Beispiel die Aufnahme von Drittstaaten in das Lobbyregister oder eine unabhängige Ethikbehörde.
Einige Kolleginnen und Kollegen werden jetzt sagen: nichts überstürzen, keinen Aktionismus. Aber ich möchte mal ganz klar sagen: Es gibt viele Regeln, die wir als Europäisches Parlament bereits mehrheitlich hier im Plenum beschlossen haben, wie zum Beispiel die Ethikbehörde. Wir müssen jetzt darauf bestehen, dass diese Regeln endlich umgesetzt werden. Die Debatte ist nämlich nicht neu, sondern gerade nur brandaktuell. Mir ist es wichtig, dass wir bei diesen Entscheidungen immer das Bild der Bürgerinnen und Bürger mit im Blick haben.

These are dark days for European democracy. I can tell you personally, colleagues, that I have always been a very proud member of this Parliament. To me, it’s the honour of my life to be elected to this Parliament. In the last days, honestly, this pride has seriously been shaken.
I myself know that most of us here are working hard, that we are honest and sincere in representing the EU citizens, but now I’m actually thinking about the millions of EU citizens who are struggling right now – the people who are lying awake at night who do not know how to pay their bills, who do not know how to get through the next month and what they had to see over the past days. This puts shame on all of us here in this Parliament.
We have to be absolutely clear: this Parliament, after what has happened, cannot do business as usual. We cannot stop at just thoughts and prayers. We have to be absolutely clear. We have to act. I want us to act, as the colleagues have said, unitedly, as pro—European Democrats.
But we have to act, and we also have to put something in writing to be clear about what we want, because we want a full inquiry into this matter. Everything has to come to the surface right now because, as people have said, trust has been broken. We have to have a dedicated position in the EP Bureau that is working on these reforms, that is working on anti—corruption, and we need to have more far—reaching measures, like, for example, the reform of the lobby register, as well as an ethics body that can make sure that we do everything in our power to prevent something like this in the future.
Indeed, colleagues, the trust of citizens has been broken, and to my understanding, rightfully so. So let us do everything we can to bring everything to light and to prevent something like this from happening again in the future. This is about more than just us. This is about protecting this House. This is about protecting democracy. This is about protecting the European project. So let us do all we can – we owe it to ourselves and we owe it to our citizens.

It is not only based on the belief that women matter less, it is actually based on the assumption that women are not fully equal and self—determined human beings, that they somehow need to be disciplined to be controlled. We are battered. We are raped. We are abused. Our choices are being restricted because we do not matter enough. But also because patriarchy tells us that we had to, that we have to be kept in check. That includes also the denial of our right to choose over our own bodies. 
Forcing a woman to go through with a pregnancy against her own will is a form of violence against women. That is true for the ten—year—old rape victim who had to travel from Ohio to Indiana to get an abortion. That is true for the 31—year—old Savita, who died in Ireland in 2012 after being denied abortion care when she was miscarrying. And that is also true for already six women who died in Poland after not receiving very much needed abortion care because of the inhumane de facto abortion ban. 
Whenever a woman dies because she did not receive the abortion care she needed to be saved, society sends a message to all of us that even in moments of absolute vulnerability, they will not help us because our lives do not matter enough. They will actually let us die. They will let us die because a fundamentalist ideology matters more than our lives. 
Honestly, I do not want to live in a society like this, and definitely I do not want to get pregnant in a society like this. So, colleagues, let us end all forms of violence against women. Let us end these inhumane abortion bans.

In der Tat, gestern, am 9. November, diesem denkwürdigen Tag deutscher und europäischer Geschichte, ist unser ehemaliger Kollege Werner Schulz bei einer Gedenkveranstaltung im Schloss Bellevue überraschend aus dem Leben gerissen worden. 
Wir erinnern Werner als einen Streiter für Bürgerrechte, beginnend in der früheren DDR, aber dann auch auf seinem Lebensweg. Er war ein Streiter für die wehrhafte Demokratie, für eine kritische Zivilgesellschaft und für Menschenrechte. Werner war ein Freiheitskämpfer, ein überzeugter Europäer, ein scharfer Kritiker Putins und vehementer Verteidiger der Ukraine. Ich glaube, das sollte uns allen zu denken geben. 
Wir werden Werner sehr, sehr schmerzlich vermissen, gerade in diesen Zeiten. Aber sein Wirken wird für uns alle, auch hier im Europäischen Parlament, unvergessen bleiben.

And also we have seen, in the recent weeks and days, movement on the negotiations on the RRP regarding Hungary. 
We believe that the European Parliament has to make its voice heard in these discussions and we are aware that there is a counter-proposal to move this to November II. I just want to give you the argument why we believe it’s important to have a first round of speakers already tomorrow, because if we want to influence the ongoing negotiations before decisions are going to be taken, we should have a debate – at least a short debate – already tomorrow. And this obviously can then also be rounded up by a debate and a resolution in November II. So please vote in favour also of having a short discussion about this tomorrow.

Terry REINTKE,2022-11-09,EN,Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 20-21 October 2022 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-09-INT-1-054-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, what we have seen in the last weeks is that Putin is obviously realising that he cannot win the war in Ukraine on the battlefield and this is why he’s resorting to other means. 
First and foremost, in Ukraine, where millions of people have been without electricity and water after Russia bombed civilian infrastructure. But the energy war has also reached the rest of Europe. And there is only one way that we can win this war, and that is to act united. This energy crisis is, in fact, a gas dependency crisis. It is a crisis of wrong political choices: wrong political choices denying the reality of the dangers of climate change; wrong political choices, denying the reality of the dangers of being completely dependent for fossil fuels on a dictator –a dictator who wants to destroy our freedom and our democracy. 
But the answer to this cannot be that we put band-aids on a broken system and simply try to import gas and fossil fuels from elsewhere – especially when this means from other dictators. The only answer can be to build a system that is reliable with energy that is cheap and sustainable: wind and solar. And, yes, for that we will need more money for renewables. 
But we will also need to invest in better insulation of buildings. Because despite this crisis, we are still wasting valuable energy every day in badly insulated housing and this costs households money and keeping warm in winter should not be just for those who can afford it. Massive investment in insulating homes is a win-win for everyone because it protects people’s health and wallets. And it is a key pillar of our climate action and our responsibility to lead with when it comes to COP27. 
And, lastly, and I know that many of you don’t want to be confronted with this, but this is real:

He said afterwards, apparently, that it was a joke, a prank. A joke about 6 million Jews who were killed in the Holocaust. A joke about the countless victims of Nazi ideology of fascism in Europe, the Roma, the trade unionists, the queer men and women, the resistance fighters, the allied soldiers who died on the battlefield for freedom, the women who were raped, the many people who were killed and tortured, the people who lost loved ones and their homes. A joke about a continent that was in complete ruins with 55 million people dead across the world. Especially today colleagues, this is not a joke. This is serious and we have to stand up to it together. And the conservatives especially have to learn from history. Let us work together and stand up to the far-right across Europe.

Terry REINTKE,2022-10-19,EN,Preparation of the European Council meeting of 20-21 October 2022 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-014-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, Madam Commission President, Mr Minister, dear colleagues, I was born in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall. My childhood and my youth were marked by an expansion of freedoms. Walls and borders fell, in 2004 we celebrated the eastern enlargement of the European Union. And over the last three decades, we strengthened the rights and freedoms of hundreds of millions of citizens through EU law.
I grew up with a sense of self-evidence that everybody can clearly see that democracy obviously is the best form of government, that through education, public discourse and finding compromise, we will build stronger, more resilient and more equal democratic societies, and that this would work almost automatically. And I must admit, this sense of self-evidence is gone.
Latest, on 24 February this year: everyone could clearly see there is a brutal, a violent and a powerful authoritarian backlash ongoing, a backlash against democracy, against freedom and against equality. Now you could argue we have to stand with Ukraine in this brutal aggression for the sake of the brave Ukrainian people, and we certainly do.
But it goes far beyond this. We have to stand with Ukraine also for our own sake, for our own freedom and our own democracy, because we have seen in the past weeks and months, light as day, that our democracies are not untouchable.
And Vladimir Putin very well knows this, this is why he’s funding the far-right. This is why he is using energy as a weapon against us. And this is why he’s using every single opportunity to try to divide us. 
And it is true that his initial strategy of dividing Europe, the West and all democratic countries who believe in a rules-based world order did not succeed. We reacted unitedly. We provided military aid to Ukraine. We adopted sanctions. We, finally, took very much needed measures to end our toxic dependence on Russian energy imports.
But, colleagues, politics is not a sprint; politics is a marathon. And we all know Putin’s game plan right now: doing whatever it takes to spread fear to destabilise our democracies in Ukraine with state terrorism, drone and missile strikes on cities and in the rest of Europe by trying to fuel the fear of energy shortages and an explosion of prices. 
And as it looks also for this, he is using whatever means necessary, whatever means necessary to create social hardships and divisions in our societies. And, Madam Commission President, a dynamic price cap on gas will not be enough to counter these injustices. We will need a bold and determined Commission also on tax and social issues, not to let the most vulnerable in our societies pay the price for this.
But he will also use whatever means necessary, threatening a global famine which will have to be prevented. But if you believe that food sovereignty can be achieved by agro-industries dependent on energy-intensive fertilisers or a global food system where massive amounts of crops are simply wasted in intensive livestock farming, you are wrong. We have to build a truly ecological, sustainable agricultural system that is also part of our commitment to the Paris goals.
And for all of this, and I’m very happy that we seem to have large unity, we will need a new common effort as Europeans. Just as with Next Generation EU, we will need to invest together a European solidarity fund with common balance to invest in through the renovation wave and the expansion of renewables, to counter Putin’s escalation strategy, to become less dependent on autocratic regimes for our energy supply.
And I’m not only talking about Russia here, because also Azerbaijan is not a democracy, to fund the necessary measures to tackle climate change and to protect our citizens from economic and social hits because social equality is essential for democracy.
Colleagues, my nephew was born in 2021, I want us to fight for a Europe in which his childhood and his youth will again be marked by an expansion of freedom, by more rights and a strengthening of democracy. I’m standing in front of you today as the newly elected Co-Chair of the Greens/EFA Group here in the Parliament but I want to appeal to all democrats in this House. The next months are not going to be easy, we will all have to make difficult choices.
But let us work together as pro-European democrats and not be taken hostage or collaborate with the far-right. And especially to you, Mr Weber, because at the end of the day, what this is going to mean is that Vladimir Putin will win. He will win the division and weakness of a far-right in Europe instead of the stability and the strength of pro-European democracy.
So let us work together, stand up to Vladimir Putin and draw a strong European Union for strong democracy.

Of course, first and foremost, also today our love and solidarity goes to the victims, their loved ones and the whole LGBTI community in Slovakia.
But I want to take this opportunity and say something else as well. Words have consequences. This attack did not start when the shooter picked up the gun. This attack started long before. It started with words, with words of hatred, uttered on social media, on the Internet, but also unfortunately uttered in places in this Parliament. Words that deny us fundamental rights. Words that deny us equality. Words that go as far as denying our very existence. Words that frame us as a threat to society and that dehumanise us, just because we love someone or because we were assigned the wrong gender at birth.
I want to say this to the far right: stop these hate campaigns. Your words have consequences. And I want to say to all of us: we cannot start at launching investigations after terror attacks like this have happened. We have to start when these words of hatred are being uttered. We have to stand up to this hatred in our societies and not just as queers, but everyone who believes in democracy, freedom, fundamental rights and peaceful societies.

And we would like to propose this for Wednesday, as the fourth point of the agenda.
Let me give you the reasons why. First of all, because we believe that the timing is crucial. We do not want such an important topic to be moved to be the last item of the agenda, so we would like to have it moved up, for Wednesday.
The second point, and I really want to make sure that you understand this, we in this Parliament, we are not only a House for talking, we are a House for delivering. The Istanbul Convention and the directive against gender—based violence are two very important proposals that can really change the situation on the ground and make more tangible our fight against sexualised violence and violence against women. This is why we ask you to support our proposal.

Now we see a protest movement in Iran that is fighting for exactly these values, led by brave women. A protest movement that has come together, and that can change not only Iran, but the whole region, and eventually the whole world. With a force and determination that is unprecedented, people are going to the streets, and they go to the streets knowing full well that they could sacrifice their own lives doing this. And they rightfully ask us, ‘What are your words, your declarations, your banners worth if now, in this moment, you are not standing with us?’.
So the EU response has to be clear: more sanctions and more determined and louder condemnation of this brutal regime, and amplifying the voices of the people who are protesting and who have sacrificed so much in this revolution.

Unfortunately, it has been cancelled yesterday by Serbian authorities. We are in very close contact both with the Serbian Government as well as with the Pride organisers, but I wanted to use this opportunity for this Parliament to show that we are a Parliament that stands for the fundamental right of freedom of assembly and with the LGBTI community all across the European Union and in Serbia and in Europe.

Democracies can die on battlefields in war, in occupation, in oppression. But democracies can also die silently. First, independent media is restricted, pushed out, journalists intimidated. Then critical civil society is defunded, swamped with lawsuits, maims foreign agents, universities are maimed in their academic freedom, political opponents are attacked, electoral reform is introduced to minimise their political success. Then you single out minorities. And we have seen this – LGBTI people, the Roma community and yes, also refugees. 
And every time you want to pass yet another anti-democratic law or reform, you basically create some fuss about one of these minorities in order to distract from what you are actually doing. What is the gain? The gain is authoritarian rule with disabled checks and balances, limited civil society and free press. And yes, in addition, a much easier way to direct public money into the pockets of people who are powerful government ministers and other politicians. 
We cannot let a democracy die in Europe. So I really urge the Commission, but also the Council to do more in order to defend democracy and rule of law inside of the European Union. I know this is a historic task, but I think we have to be up to this historic task because otherwise in 50 years, colleagues, we are going to say, why didn’t we do more when we needed to defend democracy and the rule of law in the European Union?

What we actually urgently need is calm and constructive discussions on the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol; to find practical solutions for the people on the ground, and not to play political games or to blackmail the other side.
To the people in the UK, I would like to say, rest assured that, despite all the difficulty and tension, this Parliament and the citizens in the European Union can still make a very clear difference between the UK Government and the people in the UK. We know that a majority of members of the Northern Ireland Assembly actually stand behind the protocol and want to find solutions. And we know that there are millions of people in the UK who want to have a close and strong relationship with the European Union, and we will continue to put all our efforts into making that possible.

Yes, you heard me right: a 10-year-old girl. The child-abuse doctor who was taking care of her had to arrange a referral to Indiana, a state where soon abortion could also be criminalised.
Denying abortion care to a 10-year-old victim of rape is not a policy based on another person’s political opinion. It is a form of state-supported, gender-based violence. Forcing a 10-year-old victim of rape to go through with a pregnancy is simply brutal. But cases like this will be the outcome if we do not stand up to the aggressive authoritarian backlash that we are facing right now.
We cannot simply wait and see. We have to act, and we have to act now to stabilise and strengthen our fundamental rights to bodily autonomy, to protect us, to protect our children and future generations before it is too late.

(In response to clapping from the floor) 
Are you seriously going to keep clapping until I take this off? Colleague? 
(In response to continued clapping from the floor)
Okay, then I’m going to speak against this noise.
First of all, abortion is a fact. Millions of people end their pregnancy each year. Criminalising abortion does not lower the number of abortions, it just makes them illegal and very often unsafe. Thirdly, and this is important for me, unsafe abortions are a leading, yet preventable, reason for maternal death.
So, if this was about life and health, the answer to the problem would actually be obvious: providing safe and legal access to abortion care, providing safe and legal access to contraception, providing safe and legal access to sexual education and to universal healthcare. But it is not! Because it is about exercising power: power over other people’s bodies, power over other people’s life choices, power over reproduction.
I am not a vessel to supply infants. I and only I have the right to decide over my uterus, my ovaries and my body. Until this is the case in Europe, in the US, and all over the world – and colleague, also to you specifically – we are going to continue to fight here in this Chamber and everywhere around the world. I salute the brave people in the US fighting for this, in Europe and all over the world.

And now it is actually on the Council to show some spine and not to adopt the RRP for Poland until the pre-given conditions are going to be met. 
And may I remind this House that actually these conditions are not specific political requirements. They should actually not be conditions at all because they should just be self-evident facts that everybody in the European Union can take for granted – to comply with rulings of the European Court of Justice. Now, the Commission does not seem to think that it is bound by the Treaties but I have to break it to you, Madam President, you are.

Terry REINTKE,2022-05-18,EN,Commission’s 2021 Rule of Law Report (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-18-INT-1-085-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  rapporteur. – Mr President, dear colleagues, some of us, including me, have grown up believing that the global trend towards democracy and freedom only knew one direction – emancipating citizens from authoritarian regimes, strengthening the rights of all people in our societies, making Europe and the whole world a fairer, a more equal and a more democratic place. 
I must admit, colleagues, that I do not believe that any more, and we do not have to look as far as Moscow to see attempts to undermine rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, because the rule of law crisis is also happening within our Union – a Union built on values, not just economic cooperation, a Union built on a promise to all its citizens to safeguard their rights and freedoms. 
But we are not helpless to these attacks on our values – quite the opposite. In the last years, with the clear leadership of this Parliament and many colleagues before me from different political groups and Member States, we have managed to expand the instruments for monitoring, for preventing and sanctioning attacks on the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. 
One of those instruments is indeed the rule of law report of the European Commission, and the European Parliament welcomed the introduction of the rule of law report as a tool to firstly create a common basis, an overview of the situation of rule of law in the Member States. 
We are happy about the commitment and the energy that a lot of people in the Commission have actually put into making it a reality, and before I come to the very much needed criticism, I would like to give some credit to those people in the Commission who have actually put effort into writing and preparing the reports. 
But it is also clear that a lot still needs to be done to improve the impact of the rule of law report of the European Commission. First of all, so far the report has mostly been an exercise of description – no doubt an important part, but regarding the urgency of the situation also in the European Union, we need to go beyond that. We want the next report not only to include recommendations, but to suggest very concrete follow—up in cases of non—compliance including, for example, infringement procedures, the rule of law conditionality and Article 7 proceedings. 
This would not only strengthen the report itself, but would also make the reasoning of the Commission behind how they are planning to defend the rule of law more transparent and comprehensible, not only to this Parliament, but also to the citizens in the European Union. 
Secondly, regarding the scope, Parliament has always called for a more holistic approach in the assessment. The fact that an illegitimate constitutional tribunal is restricting the reproductive rights of women shows how closely the independence of the judiciary and fundamental rights are interlinked, and this should also be reflected in this report. 
Thirdly, we want this report to be prepared in an inclusive and transparent way, because civil society organisations, academics and activists, are not ‘nice to have’ input givers, but an absolutely vital part to get full insight into what is happening on the ground. That is why we want NGOs to be able to give input, to make the process of writing and preparing this report more foreseeable – and yes, to create a panel of independent experts to give a much—needed outside view into the preparing of this report. 
Lastly, let me say this, colleagues. I have learned that rights we have taken for granted can be taken away from us again. I went into politics not only to leave a habitable planet to future generations, but also to make sure that our daughters and granddaughters do not have less rights than we have, but actually more – to enjoy more freedom, equality and more diversity in their lives. The same is true for all of society. 
I want this report to become a tool to make sure that our democracies thrive, that everyone can feel safe in their rights, and that we build a Union that shows crystal clear not only to the people in Europe, but the whole world, that even – and especially – in times of transformation, conflict and disruption, strong, viable democracies are the future, not authoritarian leaders invoking an imagined ‘better, cleaner’ past, to show clearly that commitment to the rule of law and not the law of the ruler wins the battle, not only in Ukraine, but all over Europe.

I think it was a very good debate. Maybe we had some exceptions, but in general, I’m very happy about all the input and the very engaged debate that we have had. And I think that we can clearly see, and a lot of you have given examples for this, that the situation is challenging and that in certain parts it has actually deteriorated. And that is something that we need to strongly keep an eye on, not only in the rule of law report, but also with all the other instruments that we have. 
Because I believe that, despite this backlash, we can still make it happen to defend the rule of law in the European Union. But for that, we actually need a European Commission that does not only do the paper work well, but that also has the political will and determination to stand up for the rule of law when wind is blowing in their faces. I hope that with the commitment that the Commissioner has just given, we can we can see that happen in the future. 
Let me take the last of my time to really thank the constructive work that has been put into writing this report, not only the shadow rapporteurs, not only the MEPs, but also the staff, the people from the Secretariat, the APAs. I think we have really pulled this off in a very future—oriented and constructive way, and you have made this report clearer and broader and better. 
I really believe that this approach that we form overwhelming big majorities from the left to the EPP to stand up for the rule of law in this House is something that has proven to be very successful. We have actually shown that this is not a matter of whether you are a liberal, a Christian democrat or a green, or whether you are from Finland, Spain or from Poland, that this is really something about the fundament of our societies and of the European Union. I believe that this is important because at the end of the day, it is in all of our interests to defend the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. 
Having said that, I hope that we can get a very large and broad majority for this report tomorrow, so I ask you for your support tomorrow.

That is why our support for a free European democracy against brutal Russian aggression is paramount right now. It is our historic responsibility to do everything possible to show this solidarity, including hard and far—reaching sanctions, and I’m happy to hear that a deal has been reached on a ban on Russian oil. It is an important next step, but it is certainly not the last one that we will need.
While this parliament strongly supports the sanctions, we also already see the negative consequences this war has for Europe. After years of pandemic, we see the economic struggle of many households in the European Union. And our reaction to the pandemic, despite some challenges in the beginning, was based on one of our strongest assets – solidarity.
With the Next Generation EU fund we managed to show that we can stand together in times of crisis, and the same – and probably more – is needed now because we all know what Putin is trying to do. He’s trying to divide us, to play Member State against Member States and to count that the social hardship that we will face will dry out our firm support for Ukraine. Putin is trying to divide Europe, to divide our societies. He is counting on our inability to manage this great challenge together. 
We cannot colleagues, and we will not, let him succeed in this. Let us show that we will face this challenge together, the east and the west of Europe, the north and the south. Let us show that all that he is succeeding in will be to revive the European social model, the promise of a European Union where nobody will be left behind. For that, we will need joint efforts, investments, a solidarity fund to balance out the social inequality. And we will have to proceed in creating a real social safety net on the European level by finally introducing a European minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap and, yes, also a European minimum income. 
This continent is weakest when it is divided and strongest when it is united. Let us be united against Putin!

Terry REINTKE,2022-04-06,EN,Ongoing hearings under Article 7(1) TEU regarding Poland and Hungary (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-06-INT-3-224-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, brave people in Ukraine are fighting right now in a brutal war, also to defend freedom and democracy. Ukrainian citizens are fighting for their right to live in a democratic system where the separation of powers means something, where fundamental rights and the independence of the judiciary will be safeguarded. Women are fighting for their own self-determination. LGBTI people are fighting for their fundamental right to be who they are. 
A record 91% of Ukrainians are supporting the accession to the European Union. Why is that? Because they believe in the values outlined in Article 2 of our Treaties. Because despite the setbacks and the shortcomings that we clearly see in the European Union, apparently we still stand for a promise of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights. I urge you, colleagues, let us live up to this promise also by being tough about democracy and rule of law inside our own Union. 
And this does not only need a vocal European Parliament, this most of all also needs Member States to open their mouths and to stand up for the rule of law and democracy. So I can only call on the French Presidency to move on with the Article 7 procedure, not only by hearings, because the next step is very clear. We need binding recommendations with clear timelines to protect the rule of law and fundamental rights inside of our common Union.

And I could see the people, many of them loaded with bags, a lot of children indeed, who had arrived with tired faces, exhausted from a long journey, anxious and worried. And I thought to myself, is it not that in these tired and exhausted faces, we can actually see the meaning of this Union? In these faces – and I want to say it very clearly – no matter whether their skin is white, brown or black, no matter whether their gender actually matches the markers in their documents, in these faces, the promises of this Union are reflected because this Union was built to create peace. This Union was built to defend humanity, freedom and democracy, and this Union was built to defend the rule of law against the law of the ruler. Let us live up to these promises. We have failed so many people before. Let us not fail again. Not now and not in the future.

No secret agenda, no additional obligation, just plain and simple, what all Member States agreed on; in fact, what makes the European Union. Yes, the European Union is not just a single market, but a Union of values, and this applies to all aspects of this Union, including the budget. For me, it is hard to understand that people don’t get that. 
This fundament is not only a clear commitment and promise between the Member States, but it is first and foremost a commitment and promise to our citizens. And whether you live in Finland, in Spain, in Poland or in Ireland, you have to be able to fully rely on that and you have to know that the EU institutions will defend this. 
The Commission shall promote the general interest of the Union and take appropriate initiatives to that end. It shall ensure the application of the Treaties and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them. You are the guardians of the Treaties. But right now you look more like the masterminds of delaying tactics and avoiding responsibility, Mr Commissioner. Now you come back with guidelines. Now, after these many months. Power comes with responsibility and you are neglecting this responsibility. You are failing, not only in the duties that stem from the Treaties, but you are failing millions of EU citizens that have put trust in you, that count on you. The European Parliament cannot and will not let that stand. We have to do something. And that will also mean considering the postponement of the discharge of the Commission until you no longer fail the responsibility to protect this Union and its citizens.

Herr Staatssekretär, bienvenue au Parlement européen! Frau Kommissarin, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Seit Jahren erleben wir massive Angriffe auf das sexuelle Selbstbestimmungsrecht in Europa – ein autoritärer Backlash, der versucht, uns unser Recht auf unseren eigenen Körper streitig zu machen.
Aber neben all diesen Angriffen gibt es auch Licht in der Dunkelheit, und das nicht nur in Irland, sondern endlich auch in Deutschland. Ich will es hier noch einmal sehr klar sagen, weil ich sehr häufig auf Überraschung und Unverständnis treffe, wenn ich das erkläre – gerade französischen Kolleginnen und Kollegen: In Deutschland sind Schwangerschaftsabbrüche nach wie vor im Strafgesetzbuch geregelt. Abtreibung ist nur unter bestimmten Vorbedingungen straffrei, aber immer noch nicht entkriminalisiert. Bisher können Ärztinnen und Ärzte sogar dafür belangt werden, wenn sie auch nur Informationen über Schwangerschaftsabbrüche auf ihren Webseiten veröffentlichen. Dieses Informationsverbot, der Paragraf 219a, wurde 1933 von den Nazis wieder eingeführt. Was dahintersteckte, können sich viele wahrscheinlich denken.
Jetzt – diese Woche – endlich, endlich, endlich, nach vielen Jahren des harten Kampfes – ist die ersatzlose Streichung des Paragrafen 219a endlich angestoßen worden. Das ist natürlich nicht der letzte Schritt auf einem langen Weg, aber ich finde, es ist trotzdem ein wichtiges Signal, denn die Debatte um sexuelle und reproduktive Rechte in Deutschland hinkt vielen anderen EU-Mitgliedstaaten weit hinterher. Wir brauchen endlich wieder Fortschritt, was sexuelle Selbstbestimmung in Europa angeht, denn seit Jahren kämpfen wir, wenn wir ehrlich sind, häufig einen Abwehrkampf. Dabei muss Ziel feministischer Bewegungen doch sein, vorwärts zu kommen.
Deshalb: Danke an die vielen Aktivistinnen und Aktivisten, an die Ärztinnen und Ärzte, allen voran Kristina Hänel, den Juristinnen und Juristen und den vielen, vielen anderen Menschen, die sich unermüdlich für die Streichung dieses Paragrafen eingesetzt haben. Seid euch gewiss, dieses Parlament steht ganz klar an eurer Seite! Jetzt muss es weitergehen, bis die alten Demosprüche endlich überall in Europa Realität werden: „Mein Bauch gehört mir“, „Mein Körper – meine Entscheidung“.

These were the words I started my speech with four years ago. When reports of sexual harassment also from inside of this house came to the surface, when millions broke the silence of what had been considered something you just have to be able to deal with beforehand. And yes, Me Too did change a lot.
We now have a completely different conversation from what we had four years ago, but it did not change enough. Still, cases of sexual harassment and sexual assault and not taken seriously. Still, conviction rates, even of rape, are ridiculously low.
And we have a backlash against women’s rights in full swing. And also here in this Parliament, our common House of European Democracy, issues have been talked down and urgently needed measures have still not been implemented. Like, for example, mandatory trainings or a fully independent audit of the situation.
The European Parliament indeed stands for more than just itself. The fact that the Presidents of this House have still not managed to implement all of these reforms is simply a shame. I was told back then that I would damage the reputation of the European Parliament if I spoke up too loud and too clear about the problems with sexual harassment and the necessary reforms in this Parliament.
Well, here’s the thing: neither I nor the many women who raised their voices about sexual harassment or were damaging this House; quite the opposite. It is the people who have covered this up. The people who slowed down the process of changing things who are damaging this Parliament. But here’s to you. Time’s up.

Judges being suspended for applying EU law. Prosecutors moved to the other end of the country simply for doing their job.
I mean, it is pretty obvious by now that Poland does not have a functional independent judiciary any more, and the Commission obviously knows all this. It must, because otherwise it would already have greenlighted the RRF funds going to Poland. 
The big question remains. If an independent judiciary is a precondition for receiving RRF funding, why does this not apply to all EU funding? Why has the European Commission not yet triggered the rule of law conditionality? I guess that it is because the European Council a while ago wrote something into some document.
Let me remind you of this, Commissioner. Not the European Council, it’s the EU institutions supervising the Commission. It is this House, the European Parliament.

That is why we still have to waste so much energy just to get what should actually be obvious: our body, our rights. Let us be clear: this whole debate has nothing to do with avoiding abortions. It is all about controlling women’s bodies. It is about the exercise of power. 
The latest proposals in Poland again speak volumes about this. The battle over our bodies and our lives is on again, unfortunately, and we can already see the consequences. Two women died in Poland just this year. We can already see the chilling effect it has on doctors who did not perform abortions despite the fact that the foetuses were dying, posing a threat to the women’s lives. We will never be silent about tragedies like this, no matter how long it takes. We stand with everyone who defends freedom and fundamental rights.

Rechte Parteien stellen sich gerne als die Stimme der kleinen Leute dar: gegen die abgehobenen Bürokraten in Brüssel und die hippe Großstadtschickeria. 
Aber wenn die kleinen Leute selber eine Stimme haben sollen, wenn Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer an den riesigen Transformationsentscheidungen der Wirtschaft, die jetzt gerade vor uns stehen, beteiligt werden sollen, dann hören wir plötzlich ganz andere Töne. Immer noch haben viele Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer keine oder nur beschränkte Möglichkeit, wirklich Einfluss auf Unternehmensentscheidungen zu nehmen. 
Dabei müssen wir gerade in Umbruchphasen wie jetzt alle mitnehmen. Dafür ist es zentral, Demokratie am Arbeitsplatz EU-weit zu stärken. Anstatt Menschen das Märchen zu erzählen, dass einfach alles so bleibt, wie es gerade ist, müssen sie besser eingebunden werden. Über umfassende Informations-, Konsultations- und Mitentscheidungsrechte – in Betriebsräten und in Führungsgremien. 
Wir stehen vor massiven Umbrüchen in der Art, wie wir arbeiten und produzieren. Digitalisierungsprozesse, aber auch der Klimawandel werden unsere Gesellschaft und Arbeitswelt einschneidend verändern. Und: Nein, Klimaschutz und gute, verlässliche Arbeitsplätze sind natürlich nicht unvereinbar, ganz im Gegenteil. Die Transformation hin zu einer nachhaltigen Wirtschaft schafft neue Arbeitsplätze, gerade im Industriesektor. Aber: Ja, das geht nur mit Veränderung und Umstrukturierung. Und genau daran müssen Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer umfassend beteiligt werden. Und dabei kann und muss die Europäische Union eine Rolle spielen und Rahmen schaffen, gerade wenn es um grenzüberschreitende Mitbestimmung geht. 
Und last, but not least: Dabei sollten natürlich alle Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer einbezogen werden, und nicht nur die Hälfte von ihnen. Genau deshalb haben wir uns in diesem Bericht für Geschlechterparität eingesetzt, weil Frauen in der Politik, aber natürlich genauso in der Arbeitswelt, die Hälfte der Macht verdienen. 
Ich danke der Berichterstatterin für die gute Zusammenarbeit. Herr Kommissar, wir können viel tun für ein sozialeres Europa, für Demokratie und Mitbestimmung am Arbeitsplatz: „let's do this“.

Mr Morawiecki, despite what you have been saying today, I must admit that I have to ask myself the question after what happened in Poland in the last weeks and months, whether on 7 October, when this ruling was proclaimed by the Constitutional Tribunal, you actually did not secretly open a bottle of champagne together with Vladimir Putin. Because seriously, when I look at the situation, political vision and political agenda, I see a lot of similarities between Putin and what your government is doing.
What you are trying to do is to convert Poland into an authoritarian state with weak democratic institutions and weak enforcement of fundamental rights of its citizens. And you seem to be sharing another political aim with Vladimir Putin. And that is a weak and disunited European Union.
But let me break it to you, let me break it to you. The majority of the Polish citizens disagrees with you. The majority of the Polish citizens – and they have shown that beautifully last weekend – they want to live in a strong Poland, in a strong European Union based on rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy. And we salute these people in Poland.
And it shouldn’t be here in the European Parliament that this is addressed to you. It should be you, Mr Prime Minister, who speaks to your citizens, who speaks to your judges – some of them I hear on the tribune today – to your prosecutors, to your civil society organisations, speak to them and listen to them. They want to live in a country based on rule of law, with an independence of the judiciary, with separation of powers and with fundamental rights.
And I must say I find it unbearably painful sometimes to say so many obvious things again and again in these debates. But yes, obviously, Polish citizens are EU citizens and they are protected by EU law, and it is not a nice-to-have luxury for the European Commission to protect their rights. It is the duty of the European Commission to protect their rights.
And lastly, I would like to say one thing, because I think this has been confused a lot in this debate. There is no conflict. There is no disagreement between the Polish Constitution and the EU treaties on the subject matter that we are debating, on rule of law and separation of power or the independence of the judiciary. They are completely in line there.
So please, Mr Prime Minister, bring Poland back on a path to rule of law, implement the ECJ rulings as demanded and do what your citizens demand you to do: bring Poland back really to the heart of Europe.

It’s about the situation of access to abortion in the US, and this was from before these kind of laws were passed.
And there is one scene that I will never forget, it is a healthcare worker describing the situation, when a woman is calling the abortion clinic that she’s working in. And this woman says: I’m pregnant. Nobody can know. I cannot come to the clinic right now, it’s too far away. I don’t have enough money, but I can tell you what I have in my kitchen cabinet. And then can you help me to perform an abortion over the phone?
This situation is something that we will see happen again if we do not make sure that there is access to abortion across the board. This law in Texas, and none of the crazy laws that have been passed over the last years, will actually prevent abortions from happening; what these laws prevent from happening are safe and legal abortion. And this is why we have to make clear that laws like this are called what they are: they are barbaric, and they are putting women in exactly these situations.
And some of you might say, well, OK, this is happening far away, this is happening in the US, they don’t have their religious fundamentalists under control. Well, look at the situation in Europe. Look at what has happened over the last years. We have exactly the same problems here. So, we need to have global solidarity in defence of women’s rights, in defence of sexual and reproductive rights – our bodies, our rights – everywhere in the world.

If this madness is not going to be stopped, she’s going to be 50 by the time that this sentence is over, and even if our message today cannot reach her directly right now, as she is in prison, let us make sure that it’s going to reach Lukashenko.

They were targeted because they were trying to defend rule of law, democracy, media freedom and fundamental rights. They were targeted because they were trying to defend EU values, EU law and everything that the EU stands for. They very clearly show that the rule of law, the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary are not abstract concepts. Behind these concepts there are stories of people. They have names, they have faces and their life realities are at stake here as well.
These people were in the forefront of the struggle for the rule of law. They stood up to defend EU values in Poland and, when they became targets, they waited for a determined response from the European Union. They waited and they waited some more. They were dragged in front of unlawful courts. They were the targets of smear campaigns, of hate and of threats. After waiting and waiting and waiting, finally – finally – the Commission seems to have changed its mind and is ready for more decisive action right now. 
From now on, the stories of the people who stood up for EU values, their names and their struggles, should be at the centre of the EU’s response because this is not an abstract battle of lawyers. The struggle for rule of law matters in every single citizen’s life, and the people who defended our rights and our freedoms deserve not only our solidarity, they deserve our praise and our protection.

When I see beautiful pictures from gay weddings I ask myself, how can you hate this kind of joy? And when I see a young trans person living a life as their true, authentic self, I ask myself, how can you hate someone just for wanting to be who they are? 
In Europe today we are faced with a choice, a choice between a Europe of freedom, of equality and diversity, where I can love and care for my girlfriend, where two men can get married and where a young trans woman can live her life without being afraid of violence or discrimination. And a Europe of hatred and oppression, driven by Orbán and Kaczyński and other people on this continent, where governments sponsor homophobic campaigns to cover up their systemic corruption, where our community is used as a distraction from the blatant failures of government politics. 
Now some of you might say, well, but this is only affecting a small part of the population because you are after all only a minority. But actually this is not true. It affects all of us. All of our freedoms are at stake here. And they might attack us first and in the most aggressive way but in the end this is about freedom of expression for all of us. This is about the fundamental rights of all of us, and this is about democratic principles for all of us. 
And between a Europe of freedom and a Europe of hatred and oppression, the choice is very clear. We choose freedom, we choose equality, we choose democracy. And we choose a European Commission that will stand up for this freedom, for the freedom of trans people in Hungary, for the freedom of judges in Poland, for the freedom of everyone in the European Union to love who they want to love and to be who they are.

Secondly, the guidelines presented by the Commission unfortunately have little, or very little, additional value to clarification. Thirdly – and I must say this, Commissioner – suspicion is actually high that the Commission is fully aware of this, but presented these guidelines anyway to buy some time.
Commissioner, I must say that I think we really need to end these theatre plays. We don’t need more delaying tactics, and we don’t need statements or Commissioners being very concerned about the situation of the rule of law in the European Union.

Colleagues, you have probably been following the debate that has arisen over the past days on the meaning of rainbow colours, also in the context of the Euro Cup, with UEFA taking the rather unfortunate – I would say – stance of putting down the request by the City of Munich to illuminate the stadium in Munich in rainbow colours tonight in the match between Germany and Hungary. Since then, many institutions, including town halls and a lot stadiums all across Europe, have declared their solidarity. They are going to be illuminated in rainbow colours tonight, or they are going to show rainbow flags. 
We would like to request the European Parliament do the same and join these efforts. So, Mr President, if possible, we would like to ask the European Parliament also, for tonight, to hoist a rainbow flag, because I think this Parliament agrees that the rainbow flag is not a political provocation. The rainbow flag is a sign of respect for fundamental rights, diversity and human dignity, and we should show this in this Parliament as well.

It was a hot and sunny September day, just after the summer break. I came out of the metro and there were cars, buses, and people speaking all kinds of languages all around me. As I was walking towards the European Parliament, it really looked like this ginormous beehive made out of concrete and glass. It was humming, it was full of life while, at the same time, many things actually seemed a little bit improvised and maybe even messy. 
I must be honest that probably this building taught me more about the European Union than what I had previously learned in school in textbooks or infographics. Because this Parliament, with its many doors and corridors, all the different shapes and styles, the sheer massiveness of the place, the extensions and annexes that came with the time, even the grey carpet and the art pieces all around the house, really are a perfect metaphor of the European Union because they show our diversity and, at the same time, show the imperfection and incompleteness of this project.
But, just like this building, just like any other building, the European Union needs, more than anything, a strong fundament – no single market, no freedom of movement, no Erasmus without a common basis that we can all stand on. And this fundament is actually pretty clearly spelled out in the Treaties in Article 2: democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. 
But we all know that this fundament is under heavy attack. The basis that unites us all, the precondition for the existence of the European Union, is being dismantled as we speak. But, instead of defending it, the European Commission has been watching, monitoring and writing reports over the past years, without, I must say, obviously fully grasping the seriousness of the situation we are in and without seeing the urgent need to stabilise our common fundament because that needs action. Now.
The European Parliament is ready to do what it takes in order to defend this common fundament and, if it takes pressure to make the Commission do the same, pressure you will get.

Terry REINTKE,2021-06-08,EN,European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-06-08-INT-2-280-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, the growing social divide is one of Europe’s biggest challenges today. Over 20% of Europeans are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. That is more than 92 million people in Europe. Every day, also directly here in front of the European Parliament, we can see people living in the streets without shelter.
But poverty and social exclusion cannot be understood with facts and figures alone. They shape lives. From stagnant wages, deteriorating mental health, bills that cannot be paid, and indeed people living without a roof over their heads. And the coronavirus has exacerbated all of these issues. Children and youth are the ones that are suffering the most.
For a better future for them, but for a better future for everyone in the European Union, we must be strong in solidarity. We must invest in opportunities, in fairness and in social justice. And the European Social Fund is one of the answers, with its social investment of EUR 88 billion for solidarity and social justice across and within borders. And we’re investing in children and young people so that they have the same chances, no matter where they come from and no matter who their parents are. Bringing people, especially women, back into jobs with decent wages and supporting the most marginalised people to create the conditions for a dignified life for all: that is the Europe I want and fight to live in.
And let me finish by thanking everyone, the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, for the great work. I think we have really shown that, if we are together as one voice, unified in the debates with the Council and the Commission, we can have very strong outcomes. So I think this European Social Fund is also a great success of the European Parliament as a whole.

I would then usually highlight things like the political cooperation between neighbouring countries that has led to a long-lasting peace inside of the EU, the obvious economic advantages, freedom of movement for EU citizens, the Erasmus programme, practical things like the abolishment of roaming charges, and so on and so on.
With Brexit, more and more of really everyday life examples pile up, like for example this dress. I ordered it in January online from a small-scale tailor in England for EUR 90. I received it about a month later and had to pay EUR 48 of fees and taxes – more than half of its original price. I honestly thought that this cannot be true, so I contacted the Belgian customs authorities, and here is their reply to my request: ‘Dear Sir/Madam, your package arrived on 16 February 2021 and unfortunately has to be cleared through customs. If this parcel had arrived before 1 January 2021 it would have been free of taxes.’ Just another example of the obvious.
Brexit is not a project of freedom, it is a project of building barriers. Brexit is not a project of prosperity, it is a project of bureaucracy. Brexit is not making Britain big and global, it is making it smaller and inward-looking. And this deal can, unfortunately, not change any of this – but it can be a starting point for moving back closer together, for rebuilding what Brexit has destroyed.
This deal might not be a final answer to the challenges that lie ahead of all of us, but it can be a basis for conversation. So let us take this deal, expand it where it is incomplete, change it where it needs changing, and build a relationship that can actually be sustainable and mutually beneficial again.

Thousands are battered, raped and beaten.
After deciding to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention, you might argue that Erdoğan does not care about this brutal violence against women, but actually it is worse. Autocrats like Erdoğan and his lookalikes in the European Union are afraid of free and independent women. They are afraid of societies where women can freely decide about their own bodies, their money and their lives. They are afraid of the strength of women and LGBTI movements and that is why they hate the Istanbul Convention. That is why they hate us to be protected from discrimination and violence, and that is why they attack our freedom and independence. 
We cannot let these autocrats win, not in Turkey nor in the European Union. We express our solidarity with all the feminists and queers who are standing up to this in Turkey right now. But most of all we need to have the full accession, ratification and implementation of the Istanbul Convention all over Europe.

When a legal act is adopted and enters into force, it should be used in applicable situations by the Commission, especially when it deals with such crucial matters as the functioning of democracy. But it unfortunately seems to me that the Commission follows a different logic, and that is to be very, very cautious with any activities that could potentially further escalate existing conflicts with Member States.
The story goes like this: that if the Commission acts, for example, by activating the rule of law conditionality, it would fuel eventually an anti-European sentiment in countries like, let’s say, Hungary or Poland, when actually when you look at the situation, we have got to a point where the opposite is true.
If the European Commission fails to act in defence of the rule of law and fundamental rights, there will be a rise in anti-European sentiment – not by the usual suspects, but by the people who have for years defended the European Union in these countries, who have stood up for the primacy of EU law: the judges, the prosecutors, the lawyers who have upheld the Treaties, the NGOs who have defended fundamental rights and democracy, the people who demonstrated for their rights in the streets, the many who have counted on the assurances that the European Union is an area of freedom, justice and security, and that the Commission will indeed defend fundamental rights and democracy. Listen to these people, Mr Commissioner, not only the governments in the respective countries.
And lastly, Mr Commissioner, to me, two statements that you have made in your speech seem to be contradictory. On the one hand, you say that objective reasons to activate the regulation will be used from now on. But on the other hand, you also say that there is a waiting period in which you will not act until the ECJ has made an assessment. And to me, only one of these statements can be true.
So again, this Parliament has been clear: use all legal acts, all instruments at hand, and use them now.

You paraphrase books written thousands of years ago to justify your hate. You take away our rights to distract from the shortcomings of your own politics. You scapegoat our community when all we ask for is safety. You attack our families. You tell people we are a threat. You deny us the right to be who we want to be, when all we ask for is freedom. 
But we will not give up just because you keep attacking us. We will fight for our freedom. We will fight for our safety and we will fight for our equality. This declaration might only be a first step; we know that our lives are still in danger, our rights restricted, our freedom brutally suffocated in far too many places in the European Union, but it is a step and we are many. We are everywhere and we are strong. This declaration shall be a signal. A signal to the community everywhere in Europe. This battle is far from being over. This story is far from being told, and it will take all of us together. But then, yes, then we can do it. We can make the European Union an LGBTIQ freedom zone.

Und genau an diesem Punkt stehen wir ja heute wieder. Denn auch Sachen, die bereits erkämpft schienen, werden wieder infrage gestellt.
Es schicken sich einige Länder an, gegen den Konsens und das gemeinsame commitment aus der Pekinger Erklärung vorzugehen. Und – perfider könnte es nicht sein – in ihrer verqueren Welt tun sie das angeblich sogar noch im Kampf für Menschenrechte.

And nobody who is watching the situation can deny that any longer. But, for years, the people who were pointing to that fact, most of all millions of women in Poland who were warning and saying how scared they were for their own rights, were told by many not to be so overdramatic and hysterical. And now they are angry and they have every right in the world to be so. That is why they are rising up. They are going onto the streets and protesting for their fundamental rights.
Let us learn this lesson, colleagues. When women warn that their rights are in danger, you’d better listen to them instead of trying to shut them up. But, most of all – and I can repeat this another million times if need be, Madam Commissioner – act, do something about this situation. The Polish judiciary, Polish women, the LGBTI community in Poland – what else has to happen so that we finally see true commitment from the Commission for European values and for the fundamental rights of European citizens?

To me, it was really a moment of shattering of glass ceilings and a great moment of joy.
Now, talking about the gender equality strategy: I was born in 1987 in western Germany. My mother always wanted to work and for that, a lot of barriers were put in her way. Last week, my sister became a mother for the first time, and the fact that for her, it’s going to be much easier to combine her work life and her family has a lot to do with the European Union, with a very proactive anti-discrimination policy that has really shaken up conservative countries like, for example, Germany.
But today, if we’re being honest, the women in Germany are not as equal in their rights, as for example, women in France or Sweden. That is why, especially for conservative countries like Germany, we need a strong European Union. Be it on equal pay, on the fight against gender-based violence, or for sexual and reproductive rights. We need a push from Brussels, Madam Commissioner.

Forty-six years ago, the people in Portugal took to the streets for democracy and freedom. They took to the streets to peacefully overthrow an authoritarian and oppressive regime. Their struggle for democracy and freedom will never be forgotten in Europe’s history.
Many years have passed since then, but today again authoritarians are grabbing power in Europe, threatening democracy and the rule of law. Again, we need a strong Portuguese voice in the struggle for freedom and democracy.
So, Prime Minister use the next six months to stand strong for our shared European values. This Parliament has for years now fought for a more determined European reaction to breaches of rule of law and EU citizens’ fundamental rights. Very often, unfortunately, without the Council Presidency at our side.
Let us make the next six months a spring for freedom and democracy inside the European Union, for the rights of minorities, of women, for equality and diversity. We count on you Mr Prime Minister.

First of all, no agreement was reopened. Secondly, none of the legal texts were changed. And thirdly, and most importantly, the rule of law conditionality is going to come. Viktor Orbán cannot cover that up no matter how loud he actually screams. But politically the question remains, and I personally don’t think that this is something that came out just last week, but it has been there all along. 
Is this European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, ready to stand up for the rule of law and fundamental rights even when it gets difficult? Will you apply a fully functional applicable regulation that after its adoption will enter into force on 1 January 2021, or is this Commission afraid of the noise of the autocrats and authoritarians in this Union? I can tell you – and I have to repeat myself here – the European Parliament is not afraid. With hundreds of millions of EU citizens we stand up for rule of law and democracy. Listen to us. Listen to these citizens, not to the noise coming from the autocrats and authoritarians. 
And lastly, dear colleagues in the EPP – and I say this as someone who has worked closely and constructively with many of you over the years – it does not need another debate however intense it is going to be about where Orbán and Fidesz are heading. This party is set to undermine the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy. The facts are clear. What else has to happen for you to finally take action? The time for complacency is over.

Fundamentalists and authoritarians are taking political control of the judiciary, and what is the first thing they do? They take away the rights of women, of LGBTIs and others. If we don’t do anything about it, it will continue, so again, Commissioner, do not let this happen. This is a responsibility of historic proportions. Take it and do something about it. Yesterday, with 200 Members of Parliament from all across Europe and from across the political spectrum, we sent a letter again to the Commission to say to stand up against these attacks on the rule of law and fundamental rights. 
And secondly, all my admiration, my love and my solidarity to the brave people who are resisting this in the streets of Poland right now. Our bodies, our rights in Poland and everywhere else. This Parliament salutes your strength and resilience. You make all of us proud to be Europeans.

We have to make sure that LGBTI citizens are no longer treated as second-class citizens in the European Union. We enjoy exactly the same right to freedom of movement as everybody else, and when we move, we want to stay protected by EU law. The Commission President rightly said a parent in one Member State is a parent in all Member States. I would like to add, like my colleague said, a marriage partner in one Member State should be a marriage partner in all Member States. 
But most of all, I would like to take this opportunity to remind all of us of the people we actually have to thank for the progress we have made in our community over the last few decades. It wasn’t rich people wearing fancy suits who started this movement for equality; it wasn’t in palaces or parliaments where the struggle for our rights began. It was in the streets, in dodgy bars, in forbidden places where the talk of our liberation was ignited. Black trans activists, queers, marginalised groups – who were ridiculed, attacked and oppressed – had the courage to start this. Today and every day their power made this movement. Let us never forget that.

Viktor Orbán is threatening to veto the EU budget over the rule of law conditionality. 
Some people might think, oh well, if we just back off a little bit, if we just try to see this from their perspective a little bit more, it might all turn out to be a big misunderstanding. Well, here’s the thing – it is not! This is not just a misunderstanding. These guys, they mean it. They are planning to undermine our democracy, our values, by spreading baseless conspiracy theories, by scapegoating minorities, by erasing all checks and balances we have built in hard-won battles over the centuries. This is on, and it is on now. That’s why we need to use every tool we have available in order to stand up to these attacks.
The rule of law conditionality is not just a side note in these budgetary negotiations, it is a precondition. Without it, the European Parliament is not going to accept this budget. Lastly, you can threaten us, Mr Orbán. You can try to intimidate us. You can send your trolls after us. We in this Parliament are not going to be afraid of you.

The arguments why have been exchanged extensively. What I find particularly interesting are the arguments against. The Polish and the Hungarian governments have repeatedly claimed – and we have also heard this again today in this Chamber – that this is merely some kind of left-wing evil conspiracy against conservative values in the European Union. What absolute utter nonsense. Because if we look at this proposal, at this conditionality, it is actually exactly that at its core. It’s conservative. It is law-and-order politics at its best. You play by the rules that all Member States – again, all Member States – have jointly agreed on, or you live with the consequences. And the consequences might mean that you cannot distribute EU money to your liking anymore.

Cross the sea with a rubber boat and try to see if you can sleep on the ground with your beloved ones. Try it without having enough food, water or some sort of shelter. How can this happen? Honestly, we as refugees believed that human rights would be respected in Europe. The fact that we are refugees still doesn’t mean that we should be a burden on anyone’s shoulders. No, we can work as long as there are opportunities provided for us. We know how to even offer help because we have been through so much in life.

If you think that I’m exaggerating the situation, or that I’m overstating something, I would like to give you one number, and maybe you are going to rethink that judgment. Currently 10% of all Polish judges, one in ten – in some districts, every single judge – is under urgent threat of being targeted with disciplinary measures. 
What was their crime? They think that defending the rule of law and defending the independence of the judiciary is something that you can actually say out loud. 
This is an unprecedented attack on EU values and the very foundation of the European Union, and probably not one, not two, and maybe not even five, Court of Justice of the Eureopan Union rulings are going to be enough when the ruling party is trying to take political control of the judiciary. 
We have to stand not only with the judges in Poland, but we have to stand with the EU citizens that are demanding access to justice in Poland. 
As the co-chair of the LGBTI Intergroup, I can tell you that every week, every single week, we receive more messages of worry and sometimes, I must say, despair from the LGBTI community in Poland. 
Every week there are new attacks, every week there are new lies spread, there is new anti-LGBTI propaganda, and I don’t know what to tell them anymore, Madam Commissioner, because they all ask the same question: when is the European Union finally going to act? The silence of the Commission over this summer has been screaming into the faces of all of those people whose rights are under attack right now.
And I urge you: do something, start an infringement procedure against LGBTI-free zones in Poland now, Madam Commissioner.
Lastly, and I hope, especially, that Mr Duda is watching but also to our colleagues from the Polish ruling party here in this Chamber: look at me, look at Marc, look at Malin, look at Maria. We are not an ideology. We are human beings. We are made out of flesh and blood. We want to have exactly the same fundamental human rights like everyone else. And I know that deep inside of you, you actually know that, so stop using us and the LGBTI community in Poland for your disgusting political agenda.

Hunderte neue Corona-Fälle in einem Schlachthof in Gütersloh. Und in der Tat: Das Erste, was dem nordrhein-westfälischen Ministerpräsidenten Armin Laschet dazu einfällt, ist: Das hätten ja die rumänischen und bulgarischen Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer selber mitgebracht.
Entschuldigung, aber das geht einfach gar nicht! Erstens, weil es ein altes fremdenfeindliches Narrativ bedient, nämlich dass die Ausländer irgendwelche Krankheiten mitbringen. Zweitens, weil Armin Laschet damit die Verantwortung von sich schiebt. 
In einem geeinten Europa ist es natürlich die Verantwortung des nordrhein-westfälischen Ministerpräsidenten, auch die bulgarischen und rumänischen Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer im Blick zu haben. Denn sie arbeiten häufig unter menschenunwürdigen Bedingungen zu einem Hungerlohn und sind eingepfercht in Massenunterkünften.
Deshalb brauchen wir Ministerpräsidenten, die sich um die Rechte von Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmern kümmern, egal welche Nationalität diese Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer haben, und eine Europäische Arbeitsagentur, die geltendes Recht kontrollieren und durchsetzen kann. Und wenn das alles nicht reicht, dann schrecken wir hier auch nicht davor zurück, die Standards hochzusetzen, denn dieser Ausbeutung müssen wir endlich ein Ende setzen!

Look, you have attacked journalists, you have attacked independent NGOs, you have attacked the freedom of academia, you have led smear campaigns against minorities, against the European Union, against Jean-Claude Juncker himself, and now it’s the trans community. This is not about equal gender recognition. This is a message. It is a message to everybody who is different. Either you assimilate with what we think is right or we will make you do it. 
But I can tell you — and this goes to the Hungarian Government — you will not win with this. This continent thrives with freedom and diversity and we will fight for that. You will not break this community. Trans people will not cease to exist just because you want them to, and we in this Parliament and in the European Union will stand with this community and defend their rights.

Terry REINTKE,2020-02-12,EN,Gender Equality Strategy (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-02-12-INT-3-386-0000_EN.html,"  Terry Reintke (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, there is actually a long list of things that I would like to put into this Gender Equality Strategy. I will only focus on two, because I believe they are absolutely crucial. The first one is indeed to have a legal proposal on the gender pay gap. It’s long overdue, and maybe we could suggest that it has the title: ‘We only waited 63 – I repeat 63 – years for the EU to make a proposal on the question of pay equality’. I think that would serve the purpose. 
The second issue that I believe is absolutely crucial – and colleagues have said this – is to have a directive against gender-based violence. The accession to the Istanbul Convention is not enough. The backlash against women’s rights is getting stronger across the European Union, and we need to have a clear position to stand up to that. I really believe that, with Trump in the US, with Putin in Russia and with Bolsonaro in Brazil, the European Union, despite the problems that we have in this union, is still the beacon of hope and freedom for feminists around the world. This gender—equality strategy really is one of the chances that we have to live up to their expectations, and that’s why we need to make it a success.

Now, I had the great pleasure and the honour to do my Erasmus year in the beautiful city of Edinburgh. Still, when I go there today, I really feel at home, and I think these are really the ties that we have to cherish also for the future.
And the economic and trade relationships are going to be absolutely crucial in the future. But if we want to build strong foundations, we also have to look at other issues, and that is why I think we have to fight to keep the United Kingdom in the Erasmus programme. Young people did not vote for Brexit, and I think it would be wrong to take away the opportunities from them that I and many millions of Europeans had in the past after Brexit. And that is why, if we want to build a strong relationship for the future, we should fight for a strong Erasmus programme with the UK in it.
Let us leave a light on and build bridges so that the Brits can find their way back home.

There is not only one way to build a democratic system; not all legal traditions in Europe are the same. But for all democratic systems there is a pre-condition, and that is that winning a majority does not mean that you can undermine rule of law and fundamental rights. I mentioned both of them, because actually both of these are currently under attack in Poland.
The independence of the judiciary and thus the separation of powers, which is the cornerstone of rule of law instead of the law of the ruler, but also fundamental rights, especially of those from whom they are most easy to be taken away. I believe that in our reply in the future on the discussion under the Article 7 procedure and the mechanism on the rule of law and also in the future debate, we should take both of these dimensions into consideration.
Poland is a country in the heart of Europe. Without Poland, this Union could never be complete. Polish citizens are indeed European citizens. So instead of blaming Brussels or the European Court of Justice or whoever they want for what is going on, the Polish Government should actually engage in an open and constructive dialogue to solve these very urgent and important problems. And I urge you, colleagues, to also bring this message to Poland.
Colleagues, no matter where you stand in this debate, what we have seen in smear campaigns, in hate campaigns, also against Members of this Parliament in Poland in the past month and years, is absolutely unacceptable. We can only engage in a democratic debate if we uphold the rights of, and respect towards, the other.

To be honest, there was one sentence said in that meeting that impressed me a lot, and that I wanted to repeat here in this Parliament. One of the representatives said: ‘I swore an oath on the Polish Constitution when I started my job, and with all I do I’m trying to stay true to this oath and defend the rights of Polish citizens’. 
To me, this really encapsulates what kind of people we have to protect in situations like this: these are the kind of people that defend the rule of law, defend our democracies, and are the backbone of our democracies and of the systems that all of us have been profiting from in the past. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers are one of the fundaments of this tripartite system, and that is why protecting them really also means protecting the separation of powers, and thus our democracy. Indeed – and colleagues have mentioned it – what we have seen in Poland in the past years is an organised campaign against that very important backbone, and the Commissioner has mentioned the latest developments in this field. 
This Parliament and the EU institutions have taken steps in order to defend the rule of law and European citizens in Poland, but I believe that the Article 7 procedure has actually proven to very often come too late and be too inflexible to meet all these attacks that have been happening. I think we need to have a more holistic vision, and the rule of law mechanism that is going to be proposed is one of the instruments that we need, together with budgetary measures and, of course, enabling civil society, enabling these representatives to work together. 
Let me finish by saying that I really hope the Croatian Presidency is going to follow the Finnish example in standing up for the rule of law, but just be assured that – no matter what is going to happen – this Parliament will continue to stand up for the rule of law and democracy in the future.

I ran to be an MEP to fight for more rights for citizens in the European Union. And now millions of European citizens are going to lose rights, and there is absolutely no way for me to talk this positive in any way. But I would like to end – and we are approaching the Brexit date – with two positive messages.
The first one is that all EU citizens in the UK have to be absolutely sure about the fact that there are dozens and hundreds of MEPs working here in this Parliament to keep this your Parliament as well. We will work tirelessly to defend your rights here in this Parliament.
And the second one, and this goes out to all the people in the UK who are heartbroken right now. And I know that even with this movement that is unique in European history, it has not been possible to put this decision back to the people.
But these demonstrations and all the signs and all the tweets and all your votes there were not in vain. You built something absolutely beautiful over the past years and this is the largest pro-European citizens’ movement that we have seen, and we will build on that. And trust me, one day I will see British MEPs being re-elected to this Chamber.

Imagine for one moment you are growing up in one of these regions as a young gay, lesbian or transperson. You are already lost. As it stands, being a teenager is never easy, and especially not if you’re LGBTI. You probably have a lot of questions, some of which you might not want to discuss with your parents, but in your school you cannot discuss it with anyone because your teachers are not supposed to talk to you about this. Then your city council unanimously approves a motion that states that you are against the law of nature. That the way you love, or the way that you are is threatening so-called Christian morality and family. How would you feel? Alone, abandoned, scared. 
Already LGBTI youth are at the highest risk of attempting or committing suicide inside of the European Union. These declarations are fuelling a problem that has already cost far too much hardship in European families, and we here in this Parliament we have to be the voice telling these young people - you are not alone, you are not wrong, you might be different, but that’s okay. You have rights and we, as the European Union, will stand up and defend them here in this Parliament, and we are there for you. We cannot accept such an attack on European values and fundamental rights in this Union and this is why more than this resolution that we have to adopt, we have to make this part of the Article 7 procedure against Poland because this is going beyond anything that the European Union stands for. 
And lastly, I was raised and baptised as a Roman Catholic. The Jesus that I learned about in my church, was not preaching hatred, he was preaching the exact opposite. He was not telling his followers to go with pitchforks against anyone who is different. He was preaching love, and we should bring exactly the same to the people who are marginalised today, and not use our Christianity against them (applause). So please, let’s stand up for these young LGBTI people in Poland.

Every three days – that would mean today, this Thursday, and then the following Sunday, and so on. Not out of jealousy or because there is a family drama behind it or any other reason, but because of a murderous, toxic, violent understanding of masculinity that simply needs to be stopped. In this debate, we very often feel powerless. We feel like we cannot change this overarching problem, but actually, we can.
The Istanbul Convention has been drafted by legal experts, scholars, politicians and psychologists because they did not want to wait any longer. I do not want to wait any longer. I have heard all the excuses that you can imagine – about definitions, about paragraphs, and about anything that you can think of. I tell all the member states of the Council of Europe here today, and especially the members of the European Union: ratify this Convention now. Otherwise, at least be honest enough that you don’t care enough about violence against women.

And this tale is that the EU is tired of us, they want to get rid of us and they want to mind their own business. And we have to make absolutely clear: this Parliament is still also the parliament of the British citizens. The EU is not tired of the UK. The EU is not tired of British people, and also the EU is not tired of having sensible and constructive negotiations.
This project is built on multilateralism, so we love negotiating and finding common solutions. But what we are tired of is prime ministers that are giving promises that they cannot live up to. What we are tired of are prime ministers that are using divisive language at a time, especially, like this. What we are tired of are prime ministers who don’t understand that if they do not get this deal through the House of Commons, they will have to put it back to the people, so that the British people can decide on this finally.

A lot of people are tired; a lot of people are exhausted. They want to move on. They think that, if we do not grant the extension, then we can go about other business and we can actually get rid of all this drag that we have been seeing in the last month and in the last years.
But, let us make no mistake. If we do not grant this extension and if there is a no—deal Brexit, none of this nightmare would be over. The question of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would not be solved, the budgetary questions would not be solved, and the question of the EU and UK citizens and what their future is going to be would not be solved. So now is not the moment for short—sightedness. Now is the moment for solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of British citizens who are marching in the streets. They are calling on us and counting on us to grant this extension in order to give them time to get out of this deadlock and find a solution to this mess that we are in.

Ten years ago, I would probably have signed a statement like this for all members of the European Union and I would have believed that this is something that, in the course of my lifetime, was not going to change. 
Today, I would honestly be more cautious about this statement. Yes, we still live in stable, resilient democracies, but honestly these democracies are under attack. Disinformation is being spread, scapegoating, for example, minorities and marginalised groups. There are smear campaigns against, for example, sexual and reproductive rights or the Istanbul Convention, partly funded through very blurry channels with money from abroad, not only Russia, but also, for example, the United States.
These tactics are already showing their consequences. They are destabilising our democratic decision-making processes. We have to stand up for our rights and our democracies through empowering civil society, but also through taking steps to defend our discussion space without at the same time undermining the very basis of our democracies, which is freedom of speech.
