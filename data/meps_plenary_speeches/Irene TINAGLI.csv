Irene TINAGLI,2023-05-10,IT,Impact of the interest rate increase decided by the ECB on households and workers (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-10-INT-3-533-0000_IT.html,"  Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, io credo che molte delle attuali discussioni sull'inflazione nascano da un equivoco.
Nei trattati c'è scritto che la BCE deve mantenere la stabilità dei prezzi, ma non c'è scritto che la stabilità dei prezzi è un compito esclusivo della BCE e secondo me il problema oggi nasce da qui. L'Unione e gli Stati membri potrebbero fare di più per combattere il carovita.
I dati ci dicono, è stato detto anche in questo dibattito, che oggi l'inflazione è in buona parte determinata da aumenti dei margini dei profitti di alcune imprese in alcuni settori: questo non si risolve con la politica monetaria. Con un'inflazione di questo tipo, affidarsi solo alla politica monetaria significa andare a colpire i redditi reali dei lavoratori e anche di quelle imprese che non hanno il potere di mercato di adottare certi comportamenti.
Per questo noi dobbiamo affiancare le azioni della BCE, da un lato aumentando l'efficacia delle politiche proconcorrenziali per evitare degli aumenti ingiustificati dei prezzi, e dall'altro attraverso una politica dei redditi generalizzata che coinvolga tutti, le imprese, i lavoratori, i governi e che guardi ai salari ma anche ai profitti. Questo è importante!
Come aveva intuito il compianto Ezio Tarantelli, un grande economista italiano, una politica dei redditi concertata è lo strumento migliore per abbassare le aspettative di inflazione e supportare la politica monetaria, in questo modo rendendo meno necessari gli aumenti dei tassi che poi finiscono per avere ripercussioni negative sui lavoratori, in particolare su chi ha un reddito fisso.
Questa è la direzione verso cui noi dobbiamo andare: lavorare tutti insieme e non aspettarsi dalla politica monetaria quello che la politica monetaria non può fare.

Irene TINAGLI,2023-05-09,EN,Revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-09-INT-2-022-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, a good economic governance must have two characteristics – ambition and credibility – and credibility does not rhyme necessarily with the severity as many claim. Credibility is measured by the economic, social and political sustainability of those rules. And if rules are not sustainable over time, governance is not credible. So the old governance was perhaps ambitious, but not particularly credible – it hasn’t proved that over time.
The review launched by the Commission shall set the right balance between ambition and credibility. The proposals are already moving in the right direction, but frankly, I believe that something more needs to be done to guarantee an adequate level of public investment, because these investments are key to growth in private investments as well, and these will ensure the digital, environmental and social transition challenges that we have ahead of us and this is what really we need to do to meet our citizens’ expectations. 
So, more investments today means more growth, more jobs for tomorrow and in the end, that’s what we are called to deliver. This is what citizens expect from us. This is how we can be credible.

Irene TINAGLI,2023-03-15,EN,Failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the implications for financial stability in Europe (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-15-INT-3-176-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Madam President, thank you Commissioner for being with us for this important debate. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank teaches us some lessons. Commissioner has already outlined several of them, but I want to stress two of them in particular. 
The first is that an ambitious prudential regulation is a necessary condition not only for having healthy and solid banks, but also for preventing financial dominance. The second lesson is that either there is a fully fledged bank crisis management framework able to deal with both idiosyncratic and systemic crises or, in the end, only citizens pay the bailout bill.
In the EU, we were pretty good on the first point – although the work has yet to be completed and I agree with most of the things that our rapporteur Fernández said on the Basel III negotiations – but momentum was lost on the second part, the bank crisis management framework. If we really want to strengthen the banking system and make economic policy truly independent, we have to deliver as soon as possible on one thing: the completion of the banking union.

Irene TINAGLI,2023-03-14,EN,European Semester for economic policy coordination 2023 - European Semester for economic policy coordination: Employment and social priorities for 2023 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-14-INT-2-117-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  rapporteur. – Madam President, last year, when we debated the Semester report in this House, war had just broken out in Ukraine. The war had, and is still having, a devastating impact on the Ukrainian population. To a completely different extent it had, and it still having, an impact on us as well. 
The EU was one of the most exposed advanced economies to downward risks, given its proximity to Ukraine and also the heavy reliance on energy imports, particularly on gas from Russia. The impact of high energy prices and the subsequent inflation led to the erosion of household purchasing power and industry competitiveness, in particular that of SMEs. 
So, on the one hand, we all know that the low and stable inflation rate will be an important condition for long—term sustainable economic growth and so it is important to intervene on inflation. But, on the other hand, we also know that a reduction in aggregate demand, combined with the less favourable financing conditions, which are related, when you have high interest rates, could lead to a sharp decline in investment and therefore in future economic growth. 
So investment in renewables and energy efficiency, for example, could also suffer, although these are precisely the investments required to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and structurally limit inflation driven by energy prices. So it’s quite a complicated conundrum. 
These deteriorating economic conditions have increased the vulnerabilities and risks. The rising mortgage rates and the deterioration in debt servicing capacity resulting from the decline in real income of households may cause further distress for families and for financial markets in general. So against this background, we need to act.
In our public debate, we always recall that the primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability, of course. But we should also recall that the aim of the Union as a whole should be to dampen the impact of current turbulences on the real economy and to minimise future risks, thereby defending the well-being of our citizens and preserving our production structure and the international competitiveness of our companies, as well as decent working conditions for our workers. 
So in this regard, we need adequate and coordinated fiscal, structural and regulatory policies that complement the ECB’s monetary policy actions in order to support household incomes and provide targeted and temporary support to companies suffering from supply bottlenecks and high energy costs. The policy leeway created by the activation of the general escape clause was very important and was determinant in strengthening Member States’ economic and social resilience, both during the COVID pandemic and also in the last year after the war started. 
The Commission released last week the fiscal policy guidance for 2024. However, we need more clarity as regards the medium and long term. This is why we call in this report for an urgent review of the EU fiscal framework, preferably to be completed prior to the deactivation of the general escape clause. The Commission’s communication of last November is an important step in the right direction. It addressed most of the concerns to emerge in the last years in the public debate, in particular as regards the simplification of the framework and the more tailor—made governance. The revised regulatory framework should allow Member States to have sufficient leeway to deliver decisive crisis resolution measures when they are needed and should preserve the flexibility already in—built in the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Of course, there are some issues that are not addressed in the Commission communication, but which are important. For example, the issue of macroeconomic stabilisation is not properly addressed, and we believe that the Commission should build also on the positive experience we’ve had in the past years, for example with SURE. But most importantly, we hope that there will be a debate and that the Commission, the Council, will consider our contribution to the Semester cycle and the Commission will soon be able to bring forward legislative proposals on the reform of economic governance.

This is simply not true. Not only is this debate proving that is not true, but so do all the practices that we have. The ECB President regularly comes to discuss ECB actions in the ECON Committee of this Parliament, and we scrutinise the ECB actions very seriously, very thoroughly. 
However, as President Lagarde recalled, this accountability exercise is largely based on practices, most of which are not explicitly written or codified. But now we are ready to change this, and I’m really happy about it. We’ve been waiting for a long time. Twenty—five years ago, a Parliament report called for an agreement with the soon—to—be—established ECB. For over 20 years, no progress was made. But more recently, in the ECON Committee, during one of these debates, we started to discuss with President Lagarde about this need and we started with her a fruitful dialogue. I’m so pleased that the ECB is now ready to take this step and I want to thank President Lagarde for her openness, her availability. Please let me acknowledge her work. 
The independence of the ECB must be preserved but, at the same time, independence and accountability must go hand in hand. This is what we have done, this is what we will do, and this will reinforce citizens’ trust and silence the sceptics.

I think this proposal is very positive, very good in a way that tries to find a better balance between the stability and the growth, and investments – national investments – are crucial to that end. The only thing that I wonder, in the legislative proposal that I’m confident will be presented very soon, I think that we will need a little bit more clarification on some aspects of these national investments: how they will be treated, which kind of investments, which conditions. I mean, I would like the Commission to elaborate a little bit more and to share with us some clarification on this matter.

In the communication of 2015, the Commission provides a clear and specific region for certain investments, you know, that takes into account not only compliance with macroeconomic criteria, but also the type of investment. That’s what I wanted to look into, with particular reference, but of course not limited to co-financed investments that are part of European projects. I think this is an important part. I would like to have clarification. Are you considering proposing something similar in the new governance as well? Because I think in the upcoming years, that would be very, very important and very valuable.

The resources at stake are important: EUR 20 billion in grants and more than EUR 200 billion in loans that are unused under the RRF. 
However, we asked – and we will keep asking – for more resources, because the challenges of the current energy crisis are much bigger than the resources that are finally allocated. Let’s face it, we all know what is at stake: the competitiveness of our businesses; the fragility of our families and households; energy poverty. 
So more resources will be needed. And not only resources, as to address the energy crisis we will need reforms in the energy market – temporary ones and structural ones. We know what we are talking about: a new benchmark for gas prices; a dynamic cap that we’ve been discussing; the decoupling of gas and electricity prices. 
We know what we have to do, now it’s time to deliver.

Irene TINAGLI,2022-10-18,EN,Keep the bills down: social and economic consequences of the war in Ukraine and the introduction of a windfall tax (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-18-INT-2-057-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, for months, we’ve been saying to people that the rising cost of energy was something limited and temporary. But it’s not been like that. And, let’s face it, it will not be like this in the future. Governments had to intervene massively to support families and businesses and will have to do that again in the future. But it’s not going to be sustainable in the long term, we know that.
So what does it mean? It means that this will affect the competitiveness of our businesses, will affect the single market and bring about fragmentation and will also have spill-overs that will aggravate and accelerate a possible recession all over the European Union.
So we need to intervene very quickly, urgently, on two fronts: one, provide a genuine European instrument to provide support to those countries that don’t have the fiscal space, and also to restore the single market. And then we need an incisive intervention on the energy market – yes, the joint procurement. But we need something more ambitious on the gas price, decoupling gas from energy prices.
If we’re not ambitious now, we will regret it when it will be too late.

Irene TINAGLI,2022-06-22,EN,Implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-22-INT-1-193-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Madam President, the reality around us, from the Russian aggression to the turbulence on the energy market, confirmed the genuine need for the Recovery Fund. Many of the decisions that we took during the negotiations, from the inception of the European instrument to avoid internal market fragmentation to fostering the renewables in the energy mix, were forward-looking, and the Parliament largely contributed to it. So I think this is something we need to learn from what we’ve done and be happy about it, but we also believe that further action is needed.
Fiscal capacity at the European level is currently missing. That’s something that would allow us to cope with external shocks like the Russian aggression, for example. REPowerEU represents a very good opportunity, absolutely. It’s an opportunity to drastically accelerate our energy transition and increase Europe’s energy independence. But its swift deployment is possible thanks to previous decisions taken in terms of budget and own resources. What would happen if we had new crises coming up? We wouldn’t have new tools. We wouldn’t have resources. That’s why I think we need to move forward. We need to complete our economic and monetary union, because when we are united and look forward, we are capable of great things. But we just need the tools.

Irene TINAGLI,2022-03-09,EN,European Semester for economic policy coordination: annual sustainable growth survey 2022 – European Semester for economic policy coordination: employment and social aspects in the annual sustainable growth strategy survey 2022 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-024-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  rapporteur. – Madam President, when the Commission opened the 2022 Semester cycle last autumn, war in Europe was not even in our worst nightmares. On the contrary, there were many hopes that the Union could leave behind the difficult months of the COVID pandemic and start to face more decisively the digital, environmental and social challenges. When we started to draft this report, we thought – and we still believe – that the Semester is the right tool with which to coordinate all these efforts in order to maximise their effects at Union level.
When the Semester cycle started, the economic situation we faced was quite positive and expectations were good, although we still started to notice that were some elements that could have jeopardised the strength of the recovery in 2022. First of all, we had problems of labour shortages that have involved many service sectors in the reopening phase, that in the coming months could have affected other sectors, like logistics, transport and activities related to information technologies. Second, we were still dealing with COVID. We were still dealing with the new variants, we were afraid of new waves, and there were low rates of vaccination in some parts of the world and of Europe as well. Last but not least, we started to observe a sharp rise in energy prices and, for this reason, also of the inflation rate. The succession of these elements could of course have led to some slowdown, but with an adequate policy mix and a full coordination of monetary and fiscal policy action, both at the European and national level, we were optimistic and positive that we could preserve the good prospects for 2022.
And then the war. The war has drastically changed this scenario. The tough but necessary sanctions against Putin’s regime are the right response to his barbaric attack on Ukraine, but we know they will have an important impact on our economies. We are, of course, willing to shoulder these costs. We will. We have to. But we have to be ready. We have to prepare. If the situation in Ukraine does not improve, we could have considerable consequences on the availability of some goods and above all, of course, energy products. This will result in an increase not only of energy prices, but also of the prices of other important commodities that will affect various sectors like agriculture, food industries and others.
In this regard, I see three possible risks that we have to be aware of and prepare to address. The first relates to the ability of the downstream market to absorb price increases. The risk that I see is that this could lead to a slowdown in aggregated demand, delaying the time of recovery or slowing it down compared to what we expected before. The second factor is the possible effect on wage dynamics, which could occur, of course, if the shock were to extend over a longer period of time. This will also have an impact on inflation. The third factor is that a prolonged energy crisis and, in particular, a possible asymmetric effect in energy costs for the Union would also lead to a loss of competitiveness for European industry and also to divergences in the single market. On top of that, a prolonged phase of tension on energy prices would have consequences not only on inflation, as we have seen in the past months, but also on industry costs by influencing the investment decisions of manufacturing companies. Therefore the risk is that we could see a phase of investment postponements or rescheduling. This is possible despite the high level of current demand.
So against this complex and worrisome background, I really think that all policy tools should be used to manage this delicate phase and to do it in the most appropriate, incisive way. First, EU institutions will have to empower EU governments to rise to these epochal challenges. This is why I welcome the European Commission’s willingness to adapt its fiscal guidance for 2023 to the new realities. This is not the time to go back to fiscal rules that were meant for completely different moments. They are not adequate to face the challenge that we have ahead and we need to support Member States in keeping people safe and confident for the future.
But second we also need to put in place an EU response, EU tools, as we did for COVID. We usually say that we have to learn from past mistakes, but sometimes we also have to learn from what worked, from past success. If we look back at how we managed the COVID crisis, if we look back at what worked, the key factors that explain the EU success in managing the consequences of the COVID crisis were putting in place the right policy mix, balancing monetary policy, fiscal policies and effective coordination in the policy actions of Member States, and the introduction of new European tools that were adequate to the challenge that we faced, tools that made us stronger, more united, and that allowed us to go back to a pre-crisis level of growth much faster than anybody would have thought. So let us approach this new phase with the same spirit, and I’m sure we can make it.

Irene TINAGLI,2022-02-14,EN,Formal sitting – 20th anniversary of the euro,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-14-INT-1-035-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  Chair the ECON Committee. – Madam President, 20 years is an important anniversary for anyone, but I think that if we look back at all that the euro has been through, well, then we realise how special this anniversary is. 
At first, the introduction of the single currency in Europe seemed like a risky bet. Many feared it was too early. Others thought that there were other priorities. There was some fear about it. And later, after the financial crisis, many thought that the euro was at risk and that a restoration of national currencies was upcoming. Well, it turned out quite differently, and not only is the euro still here, but it’s stronger than ever. Other Member States have decided to adopt it, and others will soon be able to do so. 
The truth is that the euro has been the key element of the last 20 years of the Union. It has complemented the single market. It has made it easier to trade and travel and live across different countries in the European Union. It has boosted European value chains, strengthening our economies. It has been the prerequisite for preserving the European monetary sovereignty in a globalised world. It has represented the cornerstone of a peaceful Union and a global actor after the end of the Cold War and German reunification. Without the euro, I’m quite sure we would be telling quite different stories.
The success of the euro is not a matter of chance. Its strength, its value and its very existence has constantly been guaranteed and preserved by the European Central Bank. Over the past 20 years, the ECB has been the true guardian of the Union’s currency, and I’m confident that it will continue to play its role even in the coming years of big innovations and changes. We’ve heard about some of those.
But the euro’s success was also the result of a strong political will. The euro was the best investment that we could have made to ensure a stable environment for the new generations. This awareness was the fundamental element that allowed us to overcome even the most difficult moments, and we’ve heard just a few minutes ago about some of those moments. 
The euro has definitely brought to us many successes, but we have to also to acknowledge and to recognise that it has not delivered all the gains that it could have delivered in all the Member States and to all the European citizens. And this is partly due to some national issues and partly the result of the fact that the Economic and Monetary Union is still incomplete – as Commissioner Gentiloni just reminded us.
So, the way ahead, therefore, is to identify the changes that are necessary to make our monetary union work for the benefit of everybody. The experience of the euro shows that even the riskiest bets, if supported by political will, can be successful and can mark a great leap forward in the history of our Union.

And this is an unprecedented challenge, which will have important consequences for the future. 
First, a successful implementation will mark another leap forward in the integration process of the European Union, and will show even to the most sceptical ones, what it means a united and strong Europe. 
Second, the national plans will help not only to support the recovery, but also to accelerate the green transition, the digital transition and the competitiveness of our Union. 
And third, let’s not forget that it will help us building a better and fair Europe. Commissioner Gentiloni, yesterday in the RRF dialogue, reminded us and today as well that of all the plans that have been approved, EUR 127 billion are dedicated to social policies. This is a huge chunk of the financial envelope, and it’s crucial to improve the lives of the European citizens, to build the kind of Europe – closer to the citizens – that we are here for.

Thanks to the work of this Parliament, big multinationals will be obliged to publicly disclose where they make profits and where they pay their taxes. The agreement also includes the obligation for companies to publish how many full-time employees they have, their turnover and taxes paid, as well as all the profits and losses they have in each country they operate in – in the European Union and in tax havens.
Thanks to this transparency, citizens will know which companies are freeriding and which are contributing their fair share to society. This is part of a bigger effort that we are leading towards creating a more just and fair society. Along with the international tax agreement, a new wave of tax justice is now on the agenda of the European debate and of the international one, and we will keep pushing and step-by-step we will build a better Union.

One hundred and thirty-six countries have finally reached an agreement to end the deleterious race to the bottom caused by deregulated international fiscal competition. This agreement will help us fight fiscal elusion, fiscal dumping and will provide new resources to many countries that can be used to address social inequalities and to support economic recovery. 
Someone says it’s not enough. Yes, many of us would have loved to see a more ambitious agreement. But now we have two choices. We can keep complaining and despise the agreement, or we can acknowledge the enormous effort made, and we can push for a rapid and effective implementation of the agreement in the European Union as soon as possible. 
We choose this latter option and we call on all the parties involved at the Commission, the Council and every Member State to take a step forward and to facilitate such fast and strict implementation. Now, more than ever, we need more tax justice. Let’s get started.

With thousands of businesses severely hit by the pandemic, we cannot tolerate these distortions any further, and we cannot properly support recovery with a system that allows hundreds of billions of euros in potential tax revenues to be lost because of evasion and fraud. 
That’s why we warmly welcome the Commission’s support for a strong global agreement, as well as its commitment to act swiftly on the implementation of such an agreement. In this regard, it is clear to us that all the main elements of the current negotiations need to be maintained, the so-called Pillar 1and Pillar 2. We need to ensure that profits are allocated where the value is created, and at the same time we need to stop a fiscal competition that translates into a deleterious race to the bottom through a minimum effective taxation to multinationals. 
There’s another important element that I want to mention in this short timeframe that I have available: the commitment to propose a measure to neutralise the misuse of shell companies. It is a strong clear sign that shows a commitment to fight tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. 
So overall we really welcome this communication. We believe it is an important step to move towards a simpler, fairer and more transparent fiscal system and we look forward to working on that.

Irene TINAGLI,2021-03-09,EN,InvestEU programme (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-09-INT-2-011-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  rapporteur. – Madam President, we are at the end of a great adventure that began in 2018 with the first Commission proposal. It was a long and bumpy journey, but we can now celebrate an important success. I would like to thank the present and past components of the negotiating team in the Parliament, and especially my co—rapporteur, José Manuel Fernandes, for what we’ve done together.
In this term we went through some exciting moments, for example when, in May 2020, the Commission represented the InvestEU proposal with a very ambitious budget, but also through moments of great concern, for example when Member States decided, during the July 2020 European Council, on a very severe cut to the InvestEU budget line, basically making it a marginal and useless programme.
We did not get discouraged. We worked to give a worthy heir to the Juncker Plan and also to create an ambitious programme capable of facing the challenges of our times. Looking at the text of the final agreement that we will vote on today, we can say that our commitment has been rewarded. There are more funds, there are more ambitious environmental targets, and there is more national European synergy, thanks to the possibility for other implementing partners to promote projects.
But our real success has been to place InvestEU at the heart of Next Generation EU. InvestEU is a long—term investment programme with a particular focus on SMEs. Its four windows cover the major objectives that the Union has set for the coming years: sustainability, innovation, research, social infrastructure. InvestEU is a programme that, perhaps more than others, highlights the paradigm shift that has taken place in the Union. The real innovation of Next Generation EU is not just the money made available to Member States. Next Generation EU is much more than that. It is the acknowledgement that there are individual and collective needs that are currently not fully satisfied. The financial crisis of 2008 and the economic crisis caused by the COVID pandemic have shown us that there is a lack of supply of goods and services that are necessary for the well-being of citizens and firms, and bridging this gap is the challenge of our time.
InvestEU is one of the responses that the Union has put in place, but InvestEU is not just about resilience: it is a tool for recovery. First of all, Parliament fought hard to create a synergy with the Recovery and Resilience Facility and, thanks to our battle, Member States will now be able to divert up to four percent of their funds from the recovery fund to guarantee investment projects eligible for InvestEU.
We also managed to resurrect a fundamental tool for the recovery that the European Council of July 2020 had basically eliminated: the Solvency Support Instrument. My colleague, Mr Fernandes, has already mentioned that, but I would like to underline the importance of this tool. Now, both the European and the national compartments of InvestEU will be able to provide capital support to small and medium—sized enterprises that got into trouble due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is perhaps the most important result that we, as a Parliament, have achieved. But let me say that, without the strong commitment of Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni during the negotiations, we probably would not have made it. So thank you, Paolo.
Our work is not done yet. We still have to scrutinise the delegated acts, in particular the one on investment guidance, and we have to appoint the governance bodies, the advisory board, the steering board and the investment committee. During one of the trilogues of InvestEU, I realised that the majority of the people that were present in the room during the negotiations were women. InvestEU is therefore the result of the work and the effort of many women. So it would be nice if the Commission, the EIB, the implementing partners, but also the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament, kept this in mind when they have to appoint their representatives in these bodies – not because it is a provision in the regulation, but because it’s the right thing to do. So thank you very much everybody.

It complements the action of the European Central Bank and partially overcomes the lack of a common European fiscal capacity for the time being.
However, we would be wrong to consider this facility as the final destination of our journey. This is just the beginning. Full recovery will require time, energy, commitment and a great sense of responsibility. In order to succeed, new forms of dialogue and interaction, solidarity and mutual understanding are required. Now, more than ever, it’s clear that having a solely national perspective for economic and budgetary measures is not only pretentious, but is short-sighted and inefficient.
So a truly European approach is the only way to foster territorial cohesion, to fight social inequalities, and to support policies dedicated to the next generation of Europeans. As a Parliament, over the next years, we will be vigilant to ensure that the Commission carries out the tasks assigned in appropriate ways so that the facility reaches its objectives, especially in terms of digital and environmental transformation, social impact and the Next Generation policies that we have envisaged for the Union.
It will not be easy. There will be bumps along the road and divisive forces will always be around the corner, and we got a sample from the debate this morning. So I say to my colleagues that we have created a powerful instrument for unity and solidarity. Now it’s our responsibility to make sure that what was conceived to unite us will not end up dividing us.

Irene TINAGLI,2020-02-11,EN,European Central Bank - annual report 2018 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-02-11-INT-2-155-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, this report to the European Parliament expresses its support for the ECB’s monetary policy and recognises that the measures implemented are consistent with its mandate, and have been decisive in preserving the euro area from deflation and also in contributing to the ongoing economic recovery. I challenge anyone to prove that today we’d be better off had we adopted different policies.
But many of the challenges we face today are new and they require further innovation in the way monetary policy is conducted. Madame Lagarde, you mentioned many of those: climate change, digitalisation... I would also add economic inequalities, especially in certain areas. All of these factors will have a significant structural impact on the way the economy works. They will affect key economic variables, financial stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy.
To fulfil its mandate of delivering price stability, the ECB will better understand how the changing climate, technological innovation and economic inequalities will affect the behaviour of households, firms and financial institutions. The ECB has the analytical capacity and resources to push the frontier of knowledge on these issues and we are definitely keen to do our part.

Irene TINAGLI,2020-01-16,EN,Institutions and bodies in the Economic and Monetary Union: Preventing post-public employment conflicts of interest (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-16-INT-4-008-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  author. – Madam President, on 17 September 2019, Mr Adam Farkas announced his resignation from his position as Executive Director of the European Banking Authority (EBA), which will be effective on 31 January 2020 to become, starting on 1 February 2020, the CEO of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a well-known lobbying company that, according to its website, is the voice of Europe’s wholesale financial services.
Let me remind you what the EBA’s responsibilities are: the EBA is responsible for supervising the EU’s banking sector and for setting technical standards implementing key financial regulations. This makes the EBA a fundamental institution that regulates and supervises the financial sector. It also, of course, makes it a constant lobbying target for the industry. AFME, like other stakeholders, appears to have permanent interactions with the EBA.
In compliance with the staff regulations and ethical rules, the EBA’s Board of Supervisors has taken a decision to impose fairly light restrictions on its Executive Director, both while in service at the EBA and after leaving the EBA. However, the restrictions on Mr Farkas’s future employment do not seem either realistic or enforceable. Unless Mr Farkas simply becomes AFME’s poster boy, I cannot really find a single topic that AFME covers that does not fall within the remit of the EBA and does not relate to the work of Mr Farkas.
Moreover, it is not clear to me who will monitor the effective application of these restrictions, in particular the one that provides that he cannot engage in lobbying or advocacy of the EBA or have professional contacts with EBA staff for 24 months after leaving the Authority. How are we going to enforce that or control that? Who’s going to do that? So, for this reason, we call for a review of this decision by the EBA Board of Supervisors. Sadly, Mr Farkas’ is not the first case, and will probably not be the last, of a post—public employment job in the private sector that poses evident problems of conflicts of interest, but we absolutely must act to ensure that this is the last. I really hope that this is the last. 
Revolving doors, where one jumps from public institutions to top positions in the private sector, from regulators to regulated, or from supervisors to supervised, and vice versa unfortunately not only undermine the credibility of the individual engaging in such behaviour, but undermine the credibility of the whole institution and, more generally, the trust that citizens have in public bodies, and the trust that citizens have in public institutions is the backbone of democracies. So we shall not tolerate our European institutions and agencies’ credibility crumbling just because of some individuals’ interest, and we should always remain vigilant in making sure and guaranteeing that they are not influenced by private interest.
For this reason, we call on the Commission to assess the current practice on post—public employment at European and national level, to extend this review to pre-public employment conflicts of interest, and also to put in place a harmonised legal framework, which should include an extension of the possibility to block professional moves and the provision of a cooling—off period that is proportionate to the specific case and accompanied by an appropriate temporary allowance. Finally, we call on the Commission also to assess whether it is appropriate that the EU agencies concerned decide for themselves on the enforcement of the rules for the prevention of conflicts of interest and how a consistent application of the rules can be ensured. 
I was glad to see that the resolution was supported unanimously by Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) with no votes against and no abstentions. I hope this is a clear signal and that the plenary widely supports the resolution as well.

Irene TINAGLI,2019-12-16,EN,Appointment of members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-16-INT-1-101-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  Rapporteur. – Madam President, with these two reports that will be voted tomorrow, the European Parliament expresses its non-binding opinion on the appointment of two new members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.
Over the last month, the Council has recommended the names of Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel and on both candidates the European Central Bank has expressed its positive opinion. The curricula vitae sent to us by the President of the European Council clearly show how both candidates are persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 238 of the Treaty.
Fabio Panetta has spent his professional career of over 30 years as a central banker. He has served in important positions at national, European and international level, and he is currently the senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy. Isabel Schnabel is a distinguished scholar of one of the most prestigious European universities and for five years she has been a member of the Council of Economic Advisers of Germany. 
The ECON Committee submitted to the two candidates a written questionnaire of over 50 questions and subsequently organised a public hearing. The vast support received by Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel, 90% and 70% respectively, demonstrates the very wide appreciation of the ECON Committee for these two excellent candidates. 
However, the two reports do not simply express our support for Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel; they recall and renew battles that the European Parliament has been fighting for some time. 
First and foremost, the battle for a selection and appointing procedure that involved the Parliament more. Of course, we appreciated that after our requests the President of the Eurogroup, Mário Centeno, by publicly announcing which nominations had been received for each position, has made the selection process more transparent than in the past. However, we reiterate our request that the Council, before each of its recommendations, submits to the Parliament a list of at least two names where at least one man and one woman are present. 
Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women in the selection procedures for top positions in our institutions, and therefore to favour gender balance in management bodies.
We already have achieved some important results in this regard. In the last six months, half of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank was renewed, and two out of the three new members are women. One third of the Executive Board will be composed by women, and let us not forget that one of them has been appointed as the President of the ECB. 
However, this is not enough. A few months ago, European newspapers published a photo of the ECB Governing Council, that is the other management body of the ECB, and there was only one woman in that picture – Madame Lagarde herself. 
Of course this is not due to the nomination process we are discussing; this is due to the fact that the non-executive part of the ECB Governing Council is composed by all the governors of the national central banks of the euro area, and all of them happen to be men. 
This makes it clear that our aim for a gender-balanced representation in European bodies can be reached only if this process takes place everywhere in national institutions first. For this reason, we call on the Council to forward our message to all Member States. 
To conclude, I just want to say that our support for these two excellent candidates, and our responsibility in guaranteeing the correct and regular functioning of the ECB, while safeguarding interinstitutional cooperation, shall not diminish our battles which we will continue fighting with determination in the future.

Irene TINAGLI,2019-12-16,EN,Fair taxation in a digitalised and globalised economy - BEPS 2.0 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-16-INT-1-127-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  author. – Madam President, USD 240 billion dollars: according to OECD estimates this is the amount of missing tax revenues due to multinationals’ tax elusion. Researchers from Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen estimated that in 2016, 40% of big companies’ profits were shifted to tax havens every year. For many countries, this means losing huge portions of tax revenues that could be used to address increasing needs in education, health care, public services and pensions, not to mention investments in physical and digital infrastructures, in research and development: all things that benefit people and firms of all sizes, small and large ones alike.
Everybody should contribute to this. But while citizens, consumers and small and medium businesses do pay their share, with effective tax rates that may go up to 40% or even more sometimes, many large multinationals do not, and this is not acceptable anymore. These situations not only create problems of social justice, but also relevant market distortions and unfair competition.
We talk a lot about building a level playing field, but what we have today on tax matters is not level at all. Yes, we want to reward efficiency, we want to reward innovation, but that should take place within a fiscal framework that applies the same tax rules to everyone. That is why we welcome the commitment of 135 countries that are negotiating, at the OECD level, a reform to address these challenges.
On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), today I present a resolution and oral questions on these reforms, and we urge the Commission and Member States to act and agree on a joint and ambitious EU position in these negotiations. I thank the Commissioner for being here today to answer our questions. The first one: how does the Commission intend to ensure a common EU position in the current international discussions on tax challenges posed by the digitalisation of the economy? And the second: how does the Commission intend to ensure that the ongoing international discussions around Pillar One are coherent and consistent with EU proposals in this field? And third: how is the Commission preparing the implementation of the outcome of such international deals? And, in the event of a regrettable absence of an international solution, when, and in what form, will the Commission act to ensure a coordinated EU reply?
Parliament expects an active role of the Commission. Europe can play a fundamental role in shaping this debate only if we are united, only if we speak with one voice. With this initiative, Parliament intends to express its position on two main points. The first one: we should reform the allocation of taxing rights, going beyond the concept of physical presence in order to include all large firms with an active engagement and interaction with customers and users – also by digital means. The second: we encourage a minimum rate to be set at a fair and sufficient level to discourage profit-shifting and prevent damaging tax competition. Indeed, according to the corporate tax statistics by OECD, there are countries where the corporate tax rate is basically zero, and we can’t accept that anymore.
So let me conclude, dear Commissioner and dear colleagues, by saying that it’s time to modernise our tax rules to ensure that big companies pay their fair share of taxes where the value is created and where the economic activity is taking place. We should not ring-fence the digital economy, but we should look at all multinationals that are increasingly finding ways to elude taxes. The current international fiscal regime creates competitive distortions among players; it deprives countries from their sovereign decision to tax corporate profits to finance public services; and most importantly, it increases inequalities and puts most of this fiscal burden on less mobile taxpayers, workers and consumers. This is simply not fair. Our citizens demand tax justice, and it is time to give them an answer.

Irene TINAGLI,2019-09-17,EN,Appointment of the President of the European Central Bank - Candidate: Ms Christine Lagarde (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-09-17-INT-2-060-0000_EN.html,"  Irene Tinagli,  Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – Mr President, with this report the European Parliament delivers its opinion on the appointment of the fourth President of the European Central Bank – an institution which became a fundamental pillar not only for the conduct of monetary policies but also for the whole process of Europe’s economic integration.
The nomination of Christine Lagarde as the first woman to serve in this position, which is itself something historic, is happening fortuitously only a few months after the solemn celebration in this Chamber of the euro’s 20th anniversary. The single currency is, first and foremost, a powerful economic tool. Not only is it the natural and indispensable complement to the single market, but it is also, as President Mario Draghi often recalls in his speeches, the prerequisite for preserving monetary sovereignty in an increasingly global and interconnected world.
The euro though is more than a mere economic tool: it is, above all, an ambitious political project. It is the cornerstone of a European Union of peace and prosperity and the indispensable instrument for protecting and supporting the European economic, social and political model – as we face the important transformations of our time.
Over the past 20 years – despite the imperfection and incompleteness of European economic governance – the single currency has shown amazing strength and resilience, even when confronted with one of the toughest economic crises in history. In addition to the political determination to maintain its integrity, the commitment by the European Central Bank and its Presidents – within their terms of reference, of course – to preserve the single currency through concrete monetary-policy action has made a fundamental contribution to protecting the euro and hence the well-being of all European citizens.
The 76 written answers provided by the candidate, which are attached to the report being voted on today, as well as the intense hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 4 September, show, I believe, not only Christine Lagarde’s awareness of the task and the challenges ahead but also her suitability to take up the baton from her predecessors and to keep on pursuing this important mission.
The large consensus which the candidate obtained in the committee constitutes, I believe, a good basis for the outcome of today’s vote. However, our task does not end here. In accordance with the Treaties and in line with our committee’s work and that of Parliament as a whole, we will keep on monitoring the activity and decisions of the ECB, inter alia through quarterly monetary dialogues, annual reports and written questions from MEPs. As always, we will be demanding. And we will expect an institution that lives up to the fundamental task it is expected to perform.
If we want to reach our ambitious objectives, however, the strength and the stability of the euro is not sufficient. We need to add new institutions, new tools and truly European economic policies to monetary-policy measures.
It is imperative to pursue an authentic deepening of our economic and monetary union, as was stated too in the programme presented by Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, which includes measures to ensure the full implementation of the social pillar, as well as growth-oriented revision of European economic governance. In this context, as co-legislator, we are ready to accept the challenge.
