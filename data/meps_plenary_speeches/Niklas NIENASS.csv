Niklas NIENASS,2023-12-11,DE,The European Elections 2024 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-11-INT-1-072-0000_DE.html,"  Niklas Nienaß (Verts/ALE).   – Frau Präsidentin, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! Ich finde, wir haben viele gute Worte gehört, und die Berichterstatter haben auch einen guten Plan vorgelegt, den wir – wenn wir ganz ehrlich sind – gar nicht gebraucht hätten, wenn der Wahlrechtsreformakt durchgegangen wäre. Aber leider glänzt der Rat mal wieder durch Abwesenheit.
Nichtsdestotrotz möchte ich an dieser Stelle insbesondere den beiden Berichterstattern zwei Dinge mit auf den Weg geben: Das Spika-System, also das Spitzenkandidatensystem, ist ein gutes. Aber ich finde, dass diese Spitzenkandidaten sich nicht nur allgemein zu Debatten stellen sollen, sondern eben auch den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern die Wahl offenlassen. Wenn man sich nicht traut, in Niedersachsen für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger auf dem Wahlzettel zu stehen, halte ich das schon für relativ schwach, liebe Freunde von der CDU.
Aber ich finde auch, Domènec, Sven: Trotz eurer Vorlage muss man sich auch ehrlich machen. Das Europäische Parlament hätte ja die Möglichkeit gehabt, den Vorschlag des Rates zurückzuweisen, und ich erwarte das beim nächsten Mal. Aber sich hier hinzustellen und zu sagen, das ist aber schlimm, dass wir jetzt hier einen Vorschlag kriegen, während ihr beide inklusive der gesamten Fraktion diesem Vorschlag zugestimmt habt, finde ich etwas zu kurz gegriffen.
Ich wünsche mir eine Vertretung in diesem Europäischen Parlament, die tatsächlich eine Vertretung der Bevölkerung der Europäischen Union ist, und zwar mit dem Mut, sie auch komplett zu vertreten. Das bedeutet, dem Rat auch mal Nein zu sagen, wenn es einen Vorschlag gibt, der nicht den Systemen und den Ideen entspricht, die wir im Vorhinein hatten. Das bedeutet, finde ich, aber auch, beim nächsten Mal zum Beispiel zu sagen, wir können uns auch gerne wieder auf Artikel 17 EUV berufen. Denn darin steht eigentlich festgehalten, dass wir maximal 18 Kommissare haben. Ich finde, als Parlament, als Vertretung der Bevölkerung Europas, darf man auch Interessen vertreten, die nicht im Interesse der Mitgliedstaaten sind.

Der Berichterstatter hat schon in vielen Punkten zusammengefasst, warum es gut und richtig ist, dass wir hier diese Netto-Null-Industrie-Verordnung anfassen. Ich muss aber ein bisschen Salz in die Suppe streuen, denn ich denke, dass das, was wir tun, in der Art und Weise, wie wir es tun, der Herausforderung nicht angemessen ist, vor der wir eigentlich stehen.
Einerseits hat die Kommission eine durchaus präzise und strategische Auswahl getroffen und sie vorgelegt. Die hat das Parlament – und das muss man selbstkritisch so sehen – ziemlich aufgeweicht und einen Blumenstrauß aufgemacht von Forderungen, die ohne jede wissenschaftliche Evidenz einfach reingestreut wurden. Das halte ich für nicht sinnvoll, wenn wir strategisch vorgehen wollen. Aber es wäre nicht so schlimm, wenn die Kommission wenigstens den Schneid gehabt hätte, ein vernünftiges, substanzielles Unterstützungspaket vorzulegen, um das Ganze auch auszufinanzieren. Ich glaube, das ist nämlich die Frage, wie wir die Investments auch hinbekommen und die Regionen stärken, damit die Industrie nicht nur nicht abwandert, sondern, ganz im Gegenteil, wir als Gewinner aus diesem Wettbewerb darum, wer die besten Technologien der Netto-Null-Bereiche aufbaut, hervorgehen können.
Und in dieser Situation dann teilweise Gelächter zu hören, wie sich Leute freuen, dass Gelder für diese Transformation gekürzt werden, halte ich für absolut schädlich. Denn am Ende ist es ja nicht das Klima, das darunter leidet, an den fehlenden Investitionen; am Ende ist es die europäische Gesellschaft. Und darauf müssen wir hinwirken, dass wir in diese europäische Gesellschaft investieren.

Niklas NIENASS,2023-10-18,EN,A true geopolitical Europe now (topical debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-18-INT-3-191-0000_EN.html,"  Niklas Nienass (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard a lot of debates here now about what to do if we have geopolitical power. But the fact is that we need to discuss how we get geopolitical power.
The answer to that is quite simple: unity. We need European unity throughout foreign policy and geopolitical questions. Every single country in this Union will fail, will weaken itself if it stands alone. From the smallest but even up to the bigger ones, even France and Germany: they will be irrelevant if we don’t stand together. We need unity.
And you, Mr Ríos, said it very precisely in the beginning: we need precise political leadership. So we need one person, one President to be followed. And it is important that if we have one President – Ms von der Leyen – that this person then does not sit at a couch next to the Council President, but instead sits at the table, and that the Council sits in the back.
We need a Commission that also sends responsible people that are not there to bore our respective counterparts into surrender, but instead are engaging in political debate. And the big answer to this is to make sure that we get rid of the unanimous vote, and then we can continue the discussion also about, for example, how to speak softly and carry a big stick. I think all of this, the discussion about a European army, it needs to be coming afterwards, it needs to follow, the question of unity needs to prevail. Then we can see where to go forward.
Let me say one last thing about the question of Nord Stream that has been mentioned. Since I come from this region, I can tell you that, with a European Union aspect, Nord Stream 2 would have never been built. 
Therefore there’s a lot of benefits for everybody if European unity prevails.

My grandma was born in a village. She received her education there. She bore her children there. Her whole life was in this village. She almost never left it. She died there in the end. And that’s a few decades ago. 
My mom was the first one of the family to fly to Paris on a plane that you could still smoke on. And when she announced that she would go and live in another city almost 100 km away – 88, to be quite frank – the whole town said she’s crazy. I mean this is insane, so far away.
And now I have been to four countries in the past week, in a night train – non-smoking, by the way – but this is completely normal now. Nowadays, young people tend to live much faster lives in different ages, different whereabouts in Europe. 
The Internet allows us to connect and exchange ideas but also a lot of fake news. And nobody is bound anymore to one location to live in for the rest of the life, especially young people. They grow up in one town, get their education in another, vocational training in the next, Erasmus in between, and then find their love of their life and move, I don’t know, to another country to live there. 
Democracy did not adapt to these changes. We still have a democratic system in which if you’re interested in your local politics, you’re required to be there for five years, commit yourself to the service and do that. But that’s really hard to do, especially for young people if they don’t even know what party they are attending tonight. Right? So they don’t know where they will be in the next five years. So we need to find ways to adapt to it. 
Also, our European parliaments – I’m not talking about this one, I’m talking about all the national ones – they have sometimes less European exchange than a Call of Duty lobby. And European law has been made commonly, but still people are not talking to each other when they’re legislators. 
At the same time, we are having Erasmus European solidarity, all these ways, creative Europe, to bring Europeans together, to create European exchanges, understandings and so on. And at the same time, when citizens move to a different country, their new home treats them as foreigners and makes it really hard to be somewhere: they’re not allowed to vote, they don’t get the easy access to social rights, and it’s really, really hard. 
We try to address all of this in this report. First of all, for the democratic question, we had the idea to increase democracy, to extend it, not to exchange representative democracy, because it’s shown its value in the past, but to improve it by bringing it into fast-paced times, by giving citizens the possibility to give their ideas to have this exchange. And we know that it works because we use this very similar motive during the Conference on the Future of Europe. 
Money cannot be a reason for less democracy, I have to say. So this is not a good reason. I also have to say, especially to the Commission, the proposal to include citizens in certain ways, in very precise and detailed questions, I think is the wrong extent because it’s endangering democracy. In the end, it will feed into the fact that they can’t really do anything about it. They have to really get into the details of it and, in the end, maybe their results are not being treated respectfully. So we need to change that. 
Second point, we have talked about the parliaments and how we can bring them into exchange, how we can make sure that this globalisation, the Europeanisation of our legislation, is getting together. 
And third, we have clearly defined what the European citizenship means and that means also an easier life through a common European administration and also more voting rights for citizens throughout Europe. 
This is a path forward – an idea to bring our democracy to the 21st century. And I thank very much our shadows that we worked so closely together with.

It is a parliament. ‘Parliament’ derives from the word parlare and means talking. I wish that we would also include ‘listening’ to it, because a lot of Members who have spoken are not here anymore to listen, actually, to responses. However, I’ll still try to sum it up a little bit.
The liberal democracy – I think this is the part where we all agree – is in danger from outside and from the inside. It’s changing and we need to improve democracy in order to make sure that it’s still working. When people call for representative democracy to have showed the best experience in the past, that might be true, but we still need to understand that things need to change in order to conserve what we want to keep precious.
One of the main things I think the press and media and everybody is saying is that people are losing trust in democracy and losing trust in politicians, and so on. This is right, but the question is: how do we bring trust back?
You don’t bring trust back by just saying, ‘Give it to me’, but you have to trust others in order to be trusted. Trusting citizens means giving them the possibility to decide, giving them tangible things to do with their own power, with their own voice. We can do that. Commissioner, you know about my ideas about using the cohesion funding for exactly that: to give citizens the power to decide where to use funding in order to empower them and to gain trust in democracy. But we should also do it when it comes to legislation. That’s why we are seeing the benefit of including partial measures of direct democracy into our representative democracy.
Let me make sure that we’re not talking about referenda after referenda for everything. I think this is not wise, but to get the people in Agoras in a meaningful discussion – we have shown it in Ireland, we have shown it during the Conference on the Future of Europe that this works. It’s really good to build up trust, to make citizens feel noticed and make sure that they get involved in the political process.
One last problem I want to mention here – and this goes to the Presidency, sorry, but I have to say, if we’re discussing democracy and we’re not allowing for blue cards in a various manner, then there’s something very badly wrong with a parliament that does not listen. So please, the Presidency of this House should make sure that blue cards are always available and that time has been taken seriously in account that blue cards can also be used.

Alternative fuel systems will only be effective when a specific person can move freely within the whole territory of the European Union and to be sure about to be able to use the alternative fuels infrastructure at any time of the whole trip. This means immediate action at the full—fledged action. The European regions be they small or big, be they rural or urban, or be they in the centre of Europe or in the outermost regions.
In order to achieve a well—functioning network, we should look even wider than the European Union and include third countries into the cooperation, especially those candidates for the Union membership. It is not only the density of the network of alternative fuels, but is also important that the adaptation of the network is specific to the specific needs of the people. So it needs to be inclusive and accessible for all people, especially those with disabilities or reduced mobility.
Before approving investment, it is therefore necessary to ensure that these systems are being developed in order to meet the needs and capacities of all people, because only an inclusive system can ensure faster results towards climate neutrality.

Zunächst einmal möchte ich den Familien und den Angehörigen, die Menschen und Angehörige verloren haben, die ihre Lebensgrundlage verloren haben, mein herzliches Beileid aussprechen. Diese Katastrophe führt uns leider wieder einmal traurig vor Augen, dass wir mitten in der Klimakatastrophe sind. Und ich glaube, wir müssen daraus endlich lernen. Wir müssen daraus Schlüsse ziehen, die mehr als einfach nur ein Leugnen sind, dass die Klimakatastrophe ja nicht schuld wäre oder dass sie nicht existiere oder dergleichen. Was also können wir lernen? 
Erstens an die Kommission: Kein Cent aus Europa darf in die Klimakatastrophe hineingesteckt werden – kein Cent mehr darf in mehr CO2-Ausstöße reingehen, in mehr Gefährdung der Umwelt.
Zweitens: Die Kommission muss eine Karte vorlegen, aus der ganz klar hervorgeht, welche Regionen besonders stark von Katastrophen gefährdet sind, damit wir dort anfangen können, wirklich etwas Resilientes aufzubauen und einen Umbau zu gestalten, damit die nächste Katastrophe nicht so schlimm wird und nicht so viele Menschenleben kostet.
Drittens: Wir müssen uns um den Umbau des Solidaritätsfonds kümmern. Der Solidaritätsfonds ist eine gute Idee, aber er funktioniert nicht in dem Maße, in dem wir ihn brauchen. Er ist zu klein, zu umständlich, zu bürokratisch und einfach nicht geeignet, den Bedrohungen der Zukunft, der Klimakrise entgegenzuwirken.
Leugnen, Herr Dorfmann, nützt hier gar nichts. Wir müssen uns der Herausforderung stellen, auch im Ansehen der Opfer dieser Katastrophen, um ihnen gerecht zu werden und weitere zu verhindern.

We don’t know if it is at the beginning or at the end of the MFF. We don’t know in which size it will come for the future. I think what we need is an insurance scheme in which all Member States make sure that they pay in when catastrophes come, so that it is available all the time for all the region when it is needed. But bureaucracy will still be need to be reduced, and not just in the line of finances, but also in the rebuilding, meaning that we need to ensure that the regions at hand have it easier to access funding, have it easier to spend the money, and to get into building up and building up resistance instead of building up the same scheme over and over. Thank you for your question.

Nonetheless, we need to focus on what we as the EU can do. And sorry for you being the only Commissioner here, but the Commission is not doing enough.
Why do we not use the power of the EU for the common agricultural policy to have an agriculture policy that is protecting the climate and the biodiversity? Why do you keep speaking about it but are not acting? Why do we not use the power of the EU with the biggest single market to use trading agreements for the better, for the climate and for biodiversity? Why, again, is the Commission not acting? We hear too much and we see too little. And honestly, this is just frustrating for me, for a whole generation, because we focus on the future. The question of the climate change is the question of how a society will live in future. The question of biodiversity is if we will live in future, and the current generation in power is just doing everything to ignore the point, and we as a future generation get anxiety of it and have a fear of the future. And that is on your back. Sorry to say that to all of you.

I think the goal is clear. We want cohesion throughout Europe and that is of utmost importance.
But the question I have is whether this is the right tool, if state aid really is the right tool to achieve it. Because the problem that we have throughout Europe is we have very rich Member States and we have very poor Member States. The problem lies in that even if we increase the limits for state aid possibilities, it does not mean that the Member States have the money and the funding to help their companies with state aid. So we see that the majority of requests for state aid come, of course, from the richest Member States who don’t necessarily need to support their companies in such a way.
So my question is whether we cannot think of a better tool to organise state aid in a fair way so that not everybody gets the same possibility, but actually gets the possibility to invest into it, and that we have a common European approach to it, to fund and to support these Member States that definitely need or these companies and these regions that need the support, but not based upon the income of their national Member State, but based on European solidarity.
That is the way how we did cohesion policy in the past, and that is the way that we should extend European cohesion policy in the future in order to bring cohesion to Europe and a real cohesion.

Wissen Sie, wenn Cristiano Ronaldo ein Tor schießt, dann macht er seinen berühmten Torjubel: „SIUUU!“ Wenn ich mir das hier angucke, das Europäische Jahr der Jugend, dann kommt mir maximal ein kleines „siu“ raus. Weil es doch am Ende so ist, dass wir zu viel verpasst haben, dass so vieles nicht draufsteht. Ich finde es immer wieder schade, dass Sie sagen müssen: Ich kann dazu nichts sagen, weil die kompetente Kommissarin oder der zuständige Kommissar nicht da ist. Wir haben hier ein Thema, das in allen Bereichen einfach eine Rolle spielt und das einfach zu häufig nicht beantwortet wird. Das Europäische Jahr der Jugend ist nicht nur letztes Jahr gewesen, es ist jedes Jahr, und das müssen wir auch mal vernünftig ernst nehmen.
Deswegen meine Frage: Was machen wir denn nun wirklich, um die jungen Menschen in Europa einzubinden in den politischen Entscheidungsprozess? Wahlalter 16 wurde angesprochen. Das haben wir als Wahlakt vorliegen. Wir haben die Frage vom Europäischen Jahr der Jugend und von der Europäischen Zukunftskonferenz zum Youth Check. Wir haben die Frage, wie wir einen ständigen Ausschuss für Jugendliche machen können. All das wird nicht angepackt. Dabei brauchen wir nicht nur Mitsprache, sondern Mitentscheidung der jungen Menschen, denn sie entscheiden über die Zukunft dieses Kontinents.

Ich möchte mich an dieser Stelle vor allen Dingen auch den Worten von Herrn Karas anschließen. Wir dürfen es nicht hinbekommen, dass wir am Ende wieder den Anschluss an Zukunftstechnologien verlieren, sondern müssen da wirklich Europa voranbringen. Das gilt aber vor allen Dingen auch für Spitzentechnologie, und wir müssen hier in Forschung und Investitionen investieren.
Aber was mir in diesen ganzen Debatten aufgefallen ist: Wenn wir über Jobs reden, dann geht es doch vor allen Dingen um die Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer und nicht nur um die reine Herstellung von Jobs. Das heißt, wir brauchen Jobs im Sinne von Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmern. Ich glaube, dabei müssen wir vor allen Dingen darauf achten, dass auch mehr und mehr Unternehmen mit in die Verantwortung von Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern kommen, damit diese Unternehmen auch Entscheidungen im Sinne der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter treffen und nicht nur im Sinne von höheren Dividendenausschüttungen.
Ich glaube, das kann man hinbekommen, wenn man eine Struktur aufbaut, in der wirklich alle, die in dem Unternehmen beschäftigt sind, daran beteiligt werden können. Dann haben wir auch eine Zukunft im Blick, die es schaffen kann, dass die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, dass die Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer wirklich auch von ihrem Job profitieren, höhere Löhne, kürzere Arbeitszeiten bekommen und nicht nur für höhere Dividenden arbeiten.
Letzter Punkt: Wir müssen diese Entwicklung nicht nur in den starken Regionen vorantreiben, sondern wir müssen es hinbekommen, dass ganz Europa wirklich regional stärker zusammenwächst, dass diese Jobs in ganz Europa entstehen, dass Spitzentechnologie auch da möglich ist, wo heute Industrie noch nicht so vorhanden ist. Das ist für einen europäischeren Ansatz im Aufbau der Industrie und Wirtschaft entscheidend.

We saw this constellation as an opportunity to prepare the European space industry for its new challenges. And IRIS will not only provide a secure internet connection, but will also establish a competitive space industry, ensuring Europe’s independent access to space.
The significance of this can be seen every day in Ukraine. The space sector requires investment just as much as it requires a change of policy that we are about to make. We want to see creative minds competing to create the smartest services, superb satellites and the most revolutionary rockets the world has ever seen.
The space-based internet provided by IRIS will eliminate any coverage gaps and bring internet access even to rural and the remotest areas all over Europe. This will drive the European economy. But this internet must also be affordable to all citizens. So, colleagues, why did you not support the Green amendment that would have ensured that this internet connection would have cost not more than 10 euros per month?
However, my colleagues, I must also praise you very much because not only have you adopted, but even embraced my proposals for sustainability criteria, which shows that you truly have a revolution in space in mind. These sustainability criteria are not only essential to continue engaging in space, but they are the first step for an international and for European space law and even lead towards a revision of international space legislation as a whole. In this sense, IRIS2 truly is revolutionary.

This report focused very much on the importance of the protection of consumers, and that is very, very important. On the one hand, it’s about online communities, to fight against sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, mobbing of each sort. And we can use filters for that, but I think it’s not really worth it, it’s something about a change of mind, change of community, where we need to approach.
On the other hand, we have the big importance of corporate ideas. They have models of games where they try to improve the focus on loot boxes, where they try to make it as opaque as possible when it comes to in-game currencies and weird monetisation.
So some developers have become really more like shell players with better graphics and that is gambling. Gambling is dangerous and we need to avoid gambling, especially when it comes to minors.
Therefore, dear Commissioner, as many have said before me, ban all loot boxes, ban all gambling and ban everything that has gambling-like mechanics because it is dangerous for our citizens.

Well, scrap all of this. This time is over. The gaming industry is already bigger than Hollywood, with a revenue of over EUR 23 billion each year. Half of all Europeans consider themselves to be gamers of some sort. So let it be known that a new generation of politicians have taken this topic very serious and that actual gamers sit at the negotiation table.
Thankfully we didn’t start a console war, but instead brought together the interests of all gamers, be they the PCMR consoles or even mobile, we brought all of them together. The video game sector brings massive benefits for our whole society. Video games are great for educational diversity, bringing new learning methods to fascinate students for science, history and much more. Video games allow for inclusive participation in culture, education and in our whole society, and Europe must strengthen the industry, especially individuals and SMEs. It creates jobs and opportunities, bringing together artistic techniques and innovative technologies.
But we also need to fight for a good gaming experience for all. That means inclusion, protection of minors and vulnerable groups. And in this light it is important that we clearly fight against loot boxes. The current use of loot boxes creates gaming addictions, threatening children, people with addiction problems, creating a harmful environment, and it’s just bad for the gaming experience as a whole. With this report we will start to outlaw the use of loot boxes.
Today is the start of a new era, an era in which we value the European gaming sector and start harnessing the multiple benefits that video games provide for our society. It’s a very good start.

In the past decades, we only had a few satellites in orbit, but now we add several hundred new satellites every year. This extensive use of outer space means more possibilities to benefit all humans on Earth. But it also means that this increase of objects – be it functional satellites or useless trash – increases the threat of collision. We and not just Europeans, but humanity as a whole needs to avoid this by all means.
Any collision can result in a cascading destruction known as the Kessler Syndrome. The implication of this is that all our space—based infrastructure would be destroyed, and the worldwide society would fall back to the technological status of the 1970s. All supply chains would be heavily interrupted because ships cannot navigate without GPS and Galileo. Worldwide communication would be cut, and this would interrupt everything from football game transmissions to renewable energy production, and the fight against climate change would be unwinnable without data from Copernicus. This is what’s at stake.
And because the stakes are so high, I am thankful that finally, Parliament and Commission see the imminent need to build up a system for space traffic management. I would have liked to see this happen much earlier because we have to do so much more and we have to be so much faster.
We need binding sustainability standards for all missions. These should be ‘leave no trace behind’, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, no light pollution, and active debris removal.
I have been pushing the Commission as well as the Member States. And to let you know, I will continue to do so to forge European space law, one common comprehensive European law to regulate all space activities in all fields necessary, so that Europe extends its activities in space to bring more benefits to all Europeans and all humans, but that’s also sustainable.
And I’m advocating for an international space law because we have to treat outer space for what it is – not a junkyard, not a playground for billionaires, not the Wild West, but a common heritage of all mankind.

We know that last year the Russians tested missiles in order to destroy their own satellites. We know that the Chinese and the Americans have done the same. And we know that this is very dangerous for peace in outer space, but also for the question of the debris, of space traffic management, as previous speakers have mentioned.
Therefore, I want to ask the Commission what it plans to do about this situation.
We have the proposal from Vice President Kamala Harris for a memorandum of understanding on anti—satellite missile tests. We should now support this initiative and bring it to the international stage to make sure that we never again use anti—satellite missiles, in order to not destroy or threaten our space—based infrastructure.
Can the Commission please comment on whether it wants to support the initiative and be a driving force in this question for the international stage?

But I would say that if you want to start a war, you first have to kill the truth. Putin has been doing this for decades now – and also in Europe, like supporting La Lega, Rassemblement National, FPÖ and the AfD. By the way, those colleagues all fled this debate like the Russians flee from the Ukrainian forces. 
But also, the biggest target group for Russia is in Russia. Russians have been brainwashed for ages, have been fed that the world hates them, that only Putin can save them, that every war is justified for Russia to free the world from ... from what? From freedom? From liberty? 
This we must tackle urgently, and this means we need to be active also in Russia. Please Commissioner, we cannot expect old people to go to the internet, get a VPN and get the information themselves. We have to address them through the radio, through TV, and we have to make sure that they are informed with the truth and that they know one thing – we are not the enemies of the Russian people. The enemies of the Russian people, the thieves of Russian money, the murders of Russian sons and husbands ... sit in the Kremlin!

I really liked the point on change of perspective – how can we bring people back to these areas? I think a lot of young families actually want to go back because I’ve talked to a lot of them and they say ‘I would like to come back, but I don’t have what I need. I don’t have a kindergarten for my children a school or something like this.’ 
So we know what people need. They need jobs. They need infrastructure like social infrastructure, kindergarten, schools. They need mobility apart from cars, like trains, buses, etc. They need a culture and possibilities to do something. They sometimes just need a fucking pub, you know, to do something and relax a little bit. 
I think this is the theory, and we now need to go to the practice. The practice means that every region is different and that we need to listen to the people and ask them, what do you need in your region? We have instruments for that, and that instrument is called CLLD. We have brought CLLD to the attention of the cohesion instruments like ESF and ERDF, but they are rarely used. 
So my question to the Commission is, why are the Member States not using this tool that we offered them? Why do the Member States not include that in their policy? And the other question that I have is, how can we bring rural development together with the ERDF, together with the ESF? Because there is economy, there is a social infrastructure in rural areas and it is needed to be improved. So please use this tool also in the future cohesion policy.

Niklas NIENASS,2022-10-03,EN,Flexible Assistance to Territories (FAST-CARE) (short presentation),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-03-INT-1-163-0000_EN.html,"  Niklas Nienaß,  rapporteur. – Madam President, just before the summer break, the Commission proposed to us yet another emergency measure to tackle the consequences of the terrible war in Ukraine. It is, though, the fifth time within two years to finance an emergency tool out of the funds of EU regional development.
During the pandemic, we agreed upon more support for regions, citizens and the economies, as well as healthcare infrastructure through the Corona Response Investment Initiative, or CRII, then followed up with CRII+. This year we needed urgent help for regions, as regards to the support of refugees fleeing from the Russian aggression in Ukraine. We called it CARE, then another one CARE+. And now we are talking about FAST-CARE.
All these responses have shown that cohesion policy is able to help citizens in the long term but also, if need be, can react swift and in order to mitigate the impact of imminent crisis. However, we must take our responsibility as parliamentarians very serious and check very carefully if an emergency procedure is always justified. It cannot become the new modus operandi for the EU’s policy to use emergency procedure over and over again.
Because what’s next? What about the daily challenges and future ones, if we do not stick to the strategic goals of our policies and renounce resilience and preparedness? Cohesion policy is of utmost importance for the whole European Union. It is the main investment tool to help us eradicate social and territorial inequalities. Cohesion policy means solidarity within and amongst regions. Cohesion policy is not just a problem solver but a tool for democracy and we need that more than ever. We cannot and should not cut it whenever a crisis arises. Instead, we must find other solutions. The Commission must find different sources of funding.
Tomorrow, we will vote on FAST-CARE – the proposed urgent procedure gave the REGI committee a lot of headaches, to be honest, because of the matters of the principle that I already mentioned. We did take our time to look into the details of the proposal and to evaluate the substance of it. And this is our constitutional duty as co-legislators.
FAST-CARE now allows flexibility in terms of transfer between funds and regions, support for not only Ukrainians but also third-country refugees, allows for more funding money for regions due to 100% subsidies and some more. And the Commission has taken up on our call for direct funding for cities and municipalities that we express as the committee in various reports. Now, 30% of the money for helping with refugees will be spent by local actors. This is a good start, but FAST-CARE also allows for phasing of delayed projects in the current funding period. It is good to save this project and make sure that these resources already spent don’t go to waste. But it may include projects like construction of regional airports which are not eligible at all anymore and this is for good reason.
All these measures are needed and, content wise, we support most of this without any hesitation. But all these measures simply mean cuts to the cohesion budget and do jeopardise the idea being behind cohesion policy, because it is a policy that not only has a real impact when it is implemented in a long-term approach by preparatory instruments and strategically considers all regions of Europe.
For emergency measures, fresh money is needed. We can’t tackle them only by shifting the existing money from A to B. We need a more flexible MFF and not only a flexibilisation on an existing regulation.
You know, I am a young European, I was involved in the Conference on the Future of Europe process as well as the internal EP process and, of course, I am definitely in favour of modifying EU rules that are clearly outdated. But we exceptionally must take all fashion in one main regard when it comes to EU cohesion policy. We need to move back to the root of it as a strategic investment to secure overall harmonious development for all cities and regions in Europe in the long term.
With emergency measures like FAST-CARE we risk to undermine our common goals, we risk to leave regions behind and we risk European democracies as a whole. Because the political shift in Europe arises, particularly from regions and citizens that do not feel heard and seen, that are left behind. And this is what we contact with a holistic and strategic approach from cohesion policy. And if we should focus on that, we would not even have to invest in most emergency measures because we would support regions in becoming resilient for future challenges, be it a pandemic in healthcare systems, be it an economic crash, or the environmental crisis ahead.
We need commitment from the Member States, we need commitment from the Commission – for the Commission to act in solidarity. So I call for the Commission that if you should propose another emergency measure, I would ask you to provide also a plan on how to solve the issues in the long run, how to fade out from the emergency to regular legislation and how to finance them without dropping out of our future. Thank you very much and I am looking forward for support for this FAST-CARE proposal.

It is the main investment tool to help us eradicate social and territorial inequalities. Every European shall be safe, free and have the means necessary to pursue a fulfilling life. We evaluate cohesion policy with these goals in mind and in order to adapt it to the current economic and social situations. Cohesion policy is a long-term and strategic investment tool that helps us make the regions more resilient. Therefore, we need to address climate change. 
Our regions were not prepared for the catastrophes that came, and they are not prepared for the catastrophes that will come. Let us help them prepare. Let us help them to adapt to climate change, to prevent the next disasters from happening, and to help them save thousands of lives. Please let us introduce a climate adaptation fund. 
Every European shall be safe, free and have the means necessary to pursue a fulfilling life. In order to address assure this, we must negate the factual differences between cities and rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to reintegrate the European agricultural fund for rural development under the roof of cohesion policy. This way, we can bring social, economic and rural development all together and enable citizens in rural areas to make the best out of their own home. 
Millions are already doing it today through LEADER, which is a community-led local development tool, and this is immensely successful. Let us learn from these regional heroes and let us include more of these bottom-up tools in cohesion policy. If we include civil society and individual citizens in the policymaking and decision process, we will see a democratisation of our whole society. This is the only way to really ensure that no one is left behind. Cities too should be able to address their respective needs in the most efficient way there is with direct access to funding and without interference from the national government. 
Let us dare more subsidiarity, ladies and gentlemen. More subsidiarity – and real subsidiarity – not just at national or regional level, but all the way down to cities, municipalities and individual citizens. This way we can ensure that every European shall be safe, free and have the means necessary to pursue a fulfilling life.

One was when all cultural entities were closed, the other one was when schools were closed. I think those are the two most prominent and also the hardest hit structural entities that we see. 
The cultural sector makes up 4.4% of Europe’s GDP. Over 8.7 million people are employed in the cultural sector. Every child goes to school, thankfully, but still we have asked for 2% of the RF to be spent on culture and 10% in education. We had to follow up on this, and see that this has not been done across Europe – the problem there being that some Member States actually invest money in culture and education while others don’t. They have not followed Parliament’s proposal to do the rightful investments, and what we see now is underfunded cultural entities in several Member States, especially those where freedom of speech is threatened by other means. 
We are seeing a recovery of different speeds. We see Member States like Italy that have invested heavily in culture and others that have invested nothing and we know that this threatens the European diversity of culture. This has to be reversed, and therefore we are calling on the Commission to reuse the unused RF resources for culture and education to make sure that every European can enjoy diversity and can enjoy very well education.

What or why do we have a different voting system? 
But my extra question is, you have said that there has been no democratic process. I mean, we have invited, for the first time ever, 800 citizens of the European Union. Have you talked to them? Have you discussed actually with them? Because I have the feeling with all the proposals that you have made and that you’ve listed, you have never had the discussion with those people because otherwise it would be quite different. 
Last part, there was a website with proposals where every citizen could propose something. None of the things that you have mentioned have been submitted to this website. Maybe, just maybe, you don’t have any democratic backing for your proposals and that is the fact why this has been not discussed at the Conference on the Future of Europe.

Mr Castaldo, I have a question. You have mentioned that there are two possibilities to go forward with Europe. One, with a closer Union that will be in the geopolitical sphere, be stronger and have a voice, and the other one, which will be playing ball with the other bigger powers. 
However, I would like your position on these two possibilities on the internal matters – which one do you think will improve the life of the citizens in Europe the best?

Not all of the citizens tell me we want to get rid of unanimity. Of course not. This is a highly technical question. The majority is just asking me: why is Europe not doing anything on this? Why don’t we solve the migration crisis? Why aren’t we helping people on the borders? Why aren’t we getting support for the low income regions? Why aren’t we getting help for everybody to have the same pension and the same minimal income? And then I have to explain to them – and maybe that’s also a job for my colleagues as well – that there are a lot of proposals on the table, but they’re just not being voted on because there’s the rule of unanimity and that we need to get rid of it in order to be a more concrete European Union. 
I think this has been the exercise that we did here. We asked citizens who were, some of them not at all involved in politics, to come here and make up their mind and propose ideas, what they think about the problems, where they see topics to be improved and everything. And then the outcome was, well, we need Treaty change. 
One last sentence about this; I will make it brief. Just because we have a convention doesn’t mean that everything that is proposed will come into law. I mean, the important thing is to bring people together and to talk about the society that we want to live in in the future. And that is what the Convention is there for. And if we stop this process from the start, then I think our society has no future.

I think it’s an excellent question but also leads to the question of what we do exactly at the convention. I believe the power of democracy lies in compromises, lies in the fact that we don’t have referenda where we just have yes or no. 
And the same thing is true also for this question as regards unanimity. Of course, I do see the point that smaller Member States need representation and that they need a certain amount of power through the use of unanimity. However, at a certain point it gets ad absurdum and we are at the point where Member States, and we have seen that multiple times, are trying to force their opinion upon everybody else as a minority, which is not what we want in a democracy and bundle up together decisions that have nothing to do with each other. 
So I think that we cannot continue with the prospect of unanimity, because it will not solve any problems, because every time your citizens say, for example, you say for your citizens, we want a stronger minimum wage. And then, I don’t know, maybe Malta says, no, this is okay for us, but we want fishing rights here and there, and therefore we block everything on the question of? This is unfair. 
So I think what we can come up with in the Convention is also a solution to that. So figure out what is the possible solution that gives the right to the smaller member states to be part of the discussion, but also that enables us to act. That is the strength that we need. Democracies can act, but we are just too slow because we are having too much unanimity.

Wir müssen unabhängig werden von russischem Gas und dafür natürlich unsere Importe diversifizieren. Aber wir müssen uns doch im gleichen Zuge nicht sofort wieder abhängig von den nächsten Diktaturen machen. Und das tun wir, wenn wir zu sehr in Infrastruktur investieren, mit der wir manifestieren, dass wir in Zukunft noch fossile Brennstoffe benötigen.
Stattdessen müssen wir unbedingt die Erneuerbaren ausbauen. Aber dafür brauchen wir Interkonnektoren, und wir brauchen einen europäischen Energiemarkt, vor allen Dingen für den Strombereich. Da muss man, finde ich, auch mal Ross und Reiter benennen. Frankreich blockiert in den Pyrenäen ganz vehement den Zugang für die Iberische Halbinsel auf den europäischen Energiemarkt. Und warum? Doch nur, um die eigene gescheiterte Atompolitik voranzutreiben.
Ich finde das extrem uneuropäisch von einem Präsidenten, der gerne das Geld seiner Bevölkerung in die Atommeiler versenken kann, aber doch nicht von ganz Europa verlangen kann, nun den Ausbau von Erneuerbaren zu blockieren. Stattdessen muss der Präsident von Frankreich und vor allem die Kommission darauf hinarbeiten, dass Frankreich endlich diese Interkonnektoren ermöglicht und wir einen wirklichen europäischen Energiemarkt bekommen und so Unabhängigkeit gewinnen und vor allen Dingen die Ukraine im Krieg unterstützen können.

These lead to great uncertainty, but not what is uncertain – that’s quite clear. We know what we want to do. We want to become independent from Russian fossil fuels by extending our energy efficiency and renewable energies like wind and solar. This will hurt Russia now and make Europe stronger in the long term. 
We know we want to help those who help refugees. Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and the whole European Union says refugees are welcome and we need to support those people. We know that we want to strengthen the EU’s unity through cohesion. Economic prosperity in all regions brings the European people together, and a united Europe will perceive any crisis. 
The uncertainty, though, is how we reach those goals. In this uncertainty, we need, on the one hand, strategic stoicism, on the other, localised expertise. The Commission needs to ensure that even under these time constraints and the Russian aggression, our strategic goals, and the means, will be kept, including the rule of law. 
Most importantly, though, the Commission must ensure that the partnership principle is valued and that local expertise is included. Partnership agreements that do not include those means must be rejected, even if we are facing time constraints. The solution to this less time is more efficient spending of money through local experts. LEADER has shown us that it can be spent very wisely and we should use CLLD and LEADER approaches in the partnership agreements. 
Lastly, let’s be honest, we also have to criticise ourselves (I’ll be finished in a second) that we have taken too long to finish this. It was a problem from the Member States also, to not have taken the time accordingly, but that should not end up hurting the regions, and we must ensure that this comes out in the end and that they get a little bit more time in the end to use the money accordingly.

Thousands of European artists, creators and performers have lost their income. Those people across Europe have used up all their savings, they have sold their instruments and tools and they still are living from day to day without clarity what comes tomorrow, or if they can put food on the table for their families.
And yet the political response throughout Europe’s Member States has been inadequate to deal with this tremendous crisis that culture currently faces. The freedom of expression, the freedom of the arts, the freedom of speech, the freedom of culture is at stake. We can have very nice laws, like Article 13 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that grant the freedom of arts and the expressions. But when artists, performers, authors, creatives are struggling to survive, those rules mean nothing.
And yes, we do have governments in the EU that use the pandemic to defund the sector, to destroy the opposition and to silence their critics. When this is happening in the Union, the EU must act to protect artists, performers and the whole sector. The EU must become the guardian of culture, of freedom.
In this light, we, the European Parliament, have worked collectively to present this report that draws the attention to the horrific situation of the cultural and creative sectors and industries CCS, as well as propose improvements. I am thankful for the cooperation that we have with the rapporteur, Ms Semedo, as well as the other colleagues and, of course, the CCFT. This cooperation shows that we have crossed paths and shared an understanding of the risks that we are facing when culture is under distress.
However, I believe we also need to go further and we need to go beyond what the treaty offers the EU to do. If we want the EU to be the guardian of culture, we need to extend the competences and weave a safety net that offers social security, health care and pensions to all creatives in the EU.
We need to see more investments from the Member States like the two per cent that we propose from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) money, and we need to get the possibility to support artists and performers with funding, even if they are in a position in their country. Only then, we will see a recovery from the situation, and only then, culture will truly be free again.

To quote the Treaty, it says ‘determined to lay the foundation of an ever closer Union among the peoples of Europe, resolved to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers that divide Europe.’
Those barriers are still here in the form of useless regulation, unnecessary bureaucratic complication and common public frustration. The European Cross—Border Mechanism solves these issues. It brings peoples across Europe together and raises economic prosperity. Regions that now are peripheric in regard to their Member States can become a central part of Europe with enhanced cooperation, with new jobs, with prosperity and an improvement of livelihood.
For three years already, 15 Member States have been blocking the ECBM. For what? It is because they think that the slightest reduction of their own competences is too much. Because national politicians are afraid that they might lose power. The Council is not acting in the interest of the European people. The ECBM is justified by the treaty to which the Member States have committed. 
The ECBM is just because it is in line with the Commission’s mandate and does not infringe competences. The ECBM is needed because it improves the situation for border regions and betters the lives of the people in those regions. The ECBM is appropriate because the benefit overwhelms the loss of competences. When will the Council adopt a position and start negotiation with us? When will you finally take the treaty seriously and start working for the European people?
I believe I speak for all my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development when I say that all our doors are open for you and for talks so that we can ease concerns, build trust and bring the European Cross-Border Mechanism to a conclusion, because we are ready to work for the European people.

We see the economy, the social programmes and even climate protection as a means to do exactly that: to support and improve the life of Europeans, of all Europeans. And this life happens in the regions. It’s the regions that are the place for social security, for fair chances and for political and individual self-determination.
The cohesion policy that we discuss today is a big step towards this green vision. We made it possible to support climate neutrality and a sustainable economy. We made it almost impossible to waste European money, either by destroying nature or by feeding into corruption. And we brought people together. We said individual citizens should make the decisions in their regions. However, we are still not finished because a ‘do no significant harm’ rule is not a ‘do no harm’ rule. And not a decrease of funds is not an increase that we urgently need. And to almost make it impossible to spend money on corruption is not making it impossible, so we still have work to do.
Cohesion policy, though, has always brought people together, has made security and solidarity and equality in Europe possible. We want security, we want solidarity, and we want unity in Europe and so we want better cohesion policy. Today we will celebrate the cohesion policy proposal that we have today.

Creative Europe ist ein Erfolgsprogramm. Aber wir dürfen auch nicht vergessen, dass der Kultur— und Kreativsektor in der größten Krise aller Zeiten steckt. Millionen Beschäftigte stehen immer noch ohne Job und ohne zukünftige Perspektive da. Dieser Umstand ist nicht nur eine Katastrophe für Kunst und Kultur – nein, diese Situation zehrt auch an den Fundamenten unserer gesamten Gesellschaft.
Die Kunstfreiheit in Europa ist bedroht, auch weil Autokraten die Kunsthochschulen unter ihre Kontrolle bringen und weil Kulturschaffende keine soziale Absicherung haben. Europa ist eine Wertegemeinschaft. Dazu gehört eben auch der Schutz von Kunst und Kultur. Dafür muss die EU aber auch Einkommensmöglichkeiten für Künstlerinnen und Künstler schaffen, wenn diese in ihren Nationalstaaten aufgrund von Ideologie finanziell ausgetrocknet werden. Creative Europe tut das bereits an vielen Stellen, nur leider sind die Bewerbungen immer noch aufwendig, und Bewilligungen sind viel zu selten. Daher gehört Creative Europe deutlich aufgestockt.
Zusätzlich benötigen wir dabei aber auch noch einen Kultur— und Medienfonds ohne grenzüberschreitende Komponente. Und vor allen Dingen brauchen wir eine europaweite soziale Absicherung von Künstlerinnen und Künstlern, die Arbeitslosigkeits—, Gesundheits— und Rentenversicherung vereint. Wo die Mitgliedstaaten versagen, muss die EU mehr tun, um die Kultur, die Kulturen und die Kulturvielfalt in Europa zu sichern.

Europa kann man nicht lernen, man muss es erleben. Aus diesem Grund haben wir mittlerweile zwei Programme, die jungen Menschen ein europäisches Erlebnis ermöglichen: das European Solidarity Corps und Erasmus+. 
Erasmus ist das wohl berühmteste europäische Programm und auch das erfolgreichste, um Menschen zusammenzubringen. Eine ganze Generation Erasmus-Babys gibt es bereits. Trotz der Notwendigkeit für das europäische Projekt und obwohl wir ein 750 Mrd. EUR schweres Budget mit dem Namen NextGenerationEU verabschiedet haben, wird gerade hier noch ein bisschen gespart. Die Kommissionspräsidentin hat das erste Versprechen, was sie in ihrem neuen Amt gegeben hat, nicht gehalten: Erasmus wurde nicht verdreifacht – das ist einfach enttäuschend. Dafür bin ich aber extrem froh, dass wir als Parlament über die Fraktionsgrenzen hinweg für dieses Jugendprogramm gestritten haben. Wir haben es geschafft, die Programme so inklusiv und zugänglich wie noch nie zu gestalten, und immerhin eine Verdoppelung des Budgets erreicht. 
Mein ganz besonderer Dank gilt dabei auch der Ausschussvorsitzenden: Liebe Sabine, Deine Sturheit hat im Rat wirklich dafür gesorgt, dass wir bei den horizontalen Prinzipien bei allen drei Dossiers etwas erreicht haben. Wir müssen dieses Programm jedoch auch weiterentwickeln und ergänzen. Wir müssen Chancengleichheit in ganz Europa herstellen und Menschen jeden Alters eine europäische Erfahrung ermöglichen. Dabei benötigen wir neben Erasmus und ESC einen gemeinsamen Bildungsraum, und wir brauchen auch ein European Sabbatical, welches einen Austausch im Berufsleben ermöglicht.

Alle in Europa schauen gerade den ESC – aber natürlich den Eurovision Song Contest und gerade das erste Halbfinale da drin. Aber ich glaube, in Zukunft werden die Menschen mit ESC dann doch eher den European Solidarity Corps verbinden, denn der ist der europäische Freiwilligendienst, und er bietet die Möglichkeit, Solidarität mit Unternehmensdrang zu verbinden und Erlebnisse mit Lernerfahrung. Ein Abenteuer erleben, Gutes tun, eine neue Sprache lernen, eine neue Kultur erleben, vielleicht sogar die Liebe seines Lebens finden, auf jeden Fall mal raus von zu Hause – all das bietet der ESC. Unser Ziel ist es, dass jeder junge Mensch in Europa diese Möglichkeit wahrnehmen kann. Und dafür werden wir in Zukunft auch das Budget, glaube ich, nochmal ziemlich drastisch erhöhen müssen. Da werden wir noch hinkommen.
Wenn wir in die Zukunft blicken, dann wünsche ich mir, dass wir durch einen gemeinsamen Bildungsraum Chancengleichheit in Europa geschaffen haben und Verständnis für und Vertrauen ineinander ermöglicht haben. Untermauert und begleitet wird die Bildungserfahrung in Europa von ständigem Austausch dank Erasmus+. Und nach der Schule ist es für unsere jungen Europäerinnen und Europäer eine Selbstverständlichkeit, ein Jahr Freiwilligendienst im Ausland zu verbringen – dank ESC. 
In der Ausbildung und später im Job werden erneut Auslandserfahrungen gesammelt dank Erasmus und European Sabbatical. Und durch die gemeinsame Erfahrung, gelebte Solidarität und den kulturellen Austausch werden wir den kommenden Generationen ein Verständnis für Europa mit in die Wiege legen, das uns allen noch unbekannt ist. Die Beschlüsse von heute sind der Beginn eines Europas, das zuvorderst aus Menschen besteht, aus Menschen, die in Vertrauen miteinander leben.

The JTF is an insurance to all people that the transformation towards a climate-friendly economy will not only be compatible for everyone, but actually be beneficial for everyone. The JTF is the promise that no one will be left behind, and it’s the starting gun for the race towards climate justice. The JTF is therefore the most important component of the Green Deal and the best tool for piercing the thick board that is climate action.
Mr Schmit, dear colleagues, now in its final form the JTF will enable much-needed investments in a forward-looking economy and in social policies. Thanks to Green pressure in the Council and in Parliament, no money will be burned in gas investments. Instead, with the green rewarding mechanism we included an incentive to turbo-charge on climate protection. And the JTF is already having success before it has even been adopted: Poland has finally announced it would phase out gas by 2049 because it does not want to forego JTF payments. However, if we want to be in line with the Paris Agreement we need to include a 2030 target. The green proposal for this was sadly rejected. Well, at least the Federal Constitutional Court agrees with us here.
Overall, we are all satisfied to finally come to an end with such a convincing regulation and yet all of us here are also very immeasurably disappointed. Why? Because despite the need for climate-friendly social policy, despite the effectiveness of this very regulation, and despite the explosive nature of climate protection policy, the Council did not provide the JTF with the adequate resources to enable this tool’s piercing potential. EUR 17.5 billion is too little money to 100 regions all over Europe. The Commission asked for 40 billion in the first proposal for Next Generation EU, but the Council cut this more than in half knowing that this budget is not sufficient. It is simply a shame. The JTF is an efficient and sharp tool. Due to the Council, though, it’s just too small. So we Greens get the impression that the current EU climate policy is like drilling through the thickest board with the smallest drill.

This intercultural dialogue is the essence of our European Union. However, this intercultural dialogue, at least with the UK, is endangered and has been endangered more than it must. 
The UK leaves the Erasmus+, a programme that not just brings European students together, but ensures youth empowerment and education in every single Member State. The UK doesn’t have to leave Erasmus, other non-EU countries are also part of it. But it does so because Johnson wants to cut the intercultural dialogue of the next generation. One that, by the way, mostly voted to remain. 
The UK also leaves Creative Europe, a programme for cultural cooperation. It doesn’t have to leave cultural Europe because other non-EU countries are also part of it, but the UK does so because Mr Johnson wants to cut the intercultural dialogue. But Johnson’s Brexit deal doesn’t just hurt those who voted to remain but also the leavers. The ESF and the cohesion funds are missing and the people in remote and de-industrialised regions are hurt by it. Fishing doesn’t work as intended and the scientific exchanges are endangered as well. Brexit only has losers and that’s a shame, but we have to do the best we can with it for the future.

They are a constant reminder that we as Europeans should always strive for the stars – metaphorically, but sometimes even literally. Dear Commissioner Breton, dear colleagues, if we get to reach for the stars again, we have today taken the very first step.
The EU space programme can form the basis for a forward—looking, unambiguous European space policy. However, if we don’t just want to reach for the stars but actually seize them, then we must go even further. We are in the midst of a new space race, and if Europe continues to proceed as it has done so far, we will lose it.
Fifty-five years after the Outer Space Treaty, only a minority of the European Member States have enacted a national space law. They missed their chance. Now we have to decide: does it still make sense to have 27 individual national space laws, only to then harmonise them once again, in the midst of a worldwide space race?
No, it does not make sense. We need a uniform European space law as soon as possible, because we need safety and security and, for the private sector, we need clarity and planning security. And if we want a competitive European space economy, we must also ensure a stable income by issuing continuous public contracts. We need very close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and to enable big projects like a European mega constellation. Only then will we stand a chance against SpaceX and Blue Origin.
Mr Breton, you are also in the very historic position of having to define what Europe’s global position will be. We have to ensure that we step forward onto the world stage to find the common ground on open regulation issues, such as space traffic management, space debris regulation and the registration of private space flights.
I personally am really proud of what we Europeans have achieved so far, in particular with world leading programmes like Copernicus, EGNOS and Galileo. However, let us not stop here. Let us accelerate and let us ensure that there are not only stars on our flag, but that there is our flag on the stars.

It’s very sad that when we talk about them that they’re not here.
When we talk about the partnership principle, we acknowledge that we politicians in Brussels, but also the politicians and the capitals, don’t know everything and they don’t know how to recover every aspect of the regional economy. Therefore, we involve the regions in the question of how to ensure that the recovery really belongs to the people, how we ensure that the recovery facilitates matters in every region of Europe. Then the question is, why aren’t we using it? Why isn’t it used for this recovery as well? 
This endangers the whole recovery project because it makes it possible that funding goes into fraud, but it also makes it possible that we lock in regions into useless investment programmes that the people on the ground don’t want. 
So please, to the Commission, you need to ensure that the that the partnership principle is valued, that the democratisation of this project, of this recovery programme is valued, and you need to ensure that no plan comes through that doesn’t value the partnership principle.

Come close, it is very simple. Not everyone living in rural areas are farmers. And I think it’s important to respect that and to understand that. Actually a majority of people in the villages don’t even work in agriculture. And still we combine agriculture and rural development. And this is one major conflict which often goes out in favour of big farmers and against a majority of people. 
The CAP is the main reason why the rural areas have seen the destruction at the moment. And your meetings show that as well. Sixty-seven meetings with agriculture organisations, none with representatives of rural policies. The long-term vision for the rural areas should rethink the structure as we make development of rural areas. And it should increase the funds for leader programmes and small farmers, as well as ensure that any development is sustainably ensured by democratic bottom-up processes so that the people, those people who actually improve their villages and make them a livelihood again, that they get the power back.

But last year we were in Kazakhstan. Exactly one year ago the delegation for Central Asia went to Kazakhstan and we all looked at everything there and we met with officials there and we actually asked how the reforms were going. They were shown to us, and it’s great to see that there were reforms undergoing, and we support this. We want to see more of that, and we are thankful that the government is going in this direction.
But at the same time, we also really had to demand a meeting with human rights defenders and with civil society, and the only place where we could actually meet them was on neutral ground, which was the EU embassy there, and that was devastating for me. We talked to them, and on the day we left, one person died in prison and others that we just talked to were imprisoned the very day we sat on the flight back. And that is the instance where we criticise in the European Union the question of human rights. And, dear government of Kazakhstan, if you want us to not publish resolutions like these, it’s very easy: follow human rights.
One last thing I want to mention to Mr Mariani, Mr Krah, and especially Mr Martusciello, who is the Chair of the EU Delegation to Kazakhstan. You are there to represent EU values, not your own personal profits.

I want to take a stance for this generation, for the young people in Uganda. It’s this young generation that demands change, democracy, fairness and some fresh new ideas. It is this generation that was stripped of these ideals, that was stripped of justice, democracy and liberty. Therefore, we must stand up for this generation and help it conquer the rights that it has. I think it is important that we take a stance, as the European Union, to do so and to deliver, but I also have to give you a quote from a young man from Uganda. He said, ‘The situation in Uganda has reached the European Parliament plenty of times, but still there is no effect here.’
I say to the Commission, Mr Schmit and Mr Borrell, this is dramatic. This is something that we need to change. This is something that the Commission has to deliver on because we must stand, not just with words, but with action for what we demand, and that is freedom and democracy.
To the young Ugandans out there, one last word to you, to this generation that has fought so bravely and so hard and so peacefully. Stay strong, stay brave and continue this fight for democracy, for justice and a government that works for the people, and also for some new fresh ideas. This is not just a privilege, but this is your right.

The goals for the recovery funds are to help swiftly and unbureaucratically and to overcome the economic crisis, while at the same time fostering European cooperation. In this regard, it was a good idea to use the framework of already existing programmes like the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which we know work well in the regions.
REACT-EU follows the logic of swift, easy, productive and European. However the Recovery and Resilience Facility does not. It is shameful to see that the vast majority of the recovery money, EUR 670 billion, is being spent with little to no European agenda behind it.
I also have to say: that REACT-EU has no obligation for the usage of Interreg is a pity. How the fact that in the first draft of REACT-EU, Interreg wasn’t even mentioned, is shameful and unworthy of a European Commission.
After images of closed borders and failed European solidarity at the peak of this crisis, after months of isolation and for thousands of families, also months of loss and mourning, we need the European coronavirus aid to be used to bring Europeans back together. We need our funds to be spent in a European way, a way that increases European exchange, cooperation and solidarity, and that benefits our citizens. Here’s how to do it.
Instead of transferring EUR 670 billion to the Member States, use them to top up these tools that foster European cohesion – top up the ERDF, the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund and the ESF, and then use the EUR 50 billion that are now planned for REACT-EU to top up the programmes that support European exchange, European culture and European education: to support Interreg, Erasmus and Creative Europe.
This is the way we should spend our European money. To enable Europeans to study, work, celebrate life, live and laugh together, until once again this crazy pandemic is finally over.
REACT-EU is not bad. It is one of the better programmes of the Next Generation EU funds, and probably the best that we can get from a Council like this, but for me as a member of the next generation of Europeans, one good programme is not enough. The overall spending is not climate-just enough, it is not social enough, and it’s definitely not European enough.

Da die Europäische Union im Bereich der Kultur relativ begrenzt zuständig ist, möchte ich mich auf den Rat spezialisieren – der heute durch Abwesenheit glänzt. Als Bundeskanzlerin Merkel am Mittwoch ´hier das Programm der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft vorgestellt hat, hat sie genau einen einzigen Satz gesagt, der irgendetwas mit Kultur zu tun hatte, nämlich den zweihundertfünfzigsten Geburtstag Ludwig von Beethovens erwähnt. 
Deswegen möchte ich mit einem Zitat von ihm starten: „Und die Welt muss ich verachten, die nicht ahnt, dass Musik höhere Offenbarung ist als alle Weisheit und Philosophie. Sie ist der Wein, der zur neuen Erzeugung begeistert.“ 
Wer Beethovens Vermächtnis feiert, aber nicht einmal über die Förderung von Kunst und Kultur in diesen Zeiten der Krise redet, wäre von dem alten Meister mit viel Verachtung gestraft worden. Weder die Kanzlerin noch die Kommissionspräsidentin haben durch Worte oder Taten erkennen lassen, dass sie verstehen, in welcher desaströsen Lage sich der europäische Kultur- und Kreativsektor befindet. „In Vielfalt geeint“ ist das europäische Motto, doch diese Vielfalt droht zu verschwinden, wenn dem gesamten Kultur- und Kreativsektor in ganz Europa nicht geholfen wird.
Um den Kulturministern und den Staats- und Regierungschefs auf die Sprünge zu helfen, was das bedeutet: Wir brauchen ein unbürokratisches Grundeinkommen für Künstlerinnen und Künstler. Wir brauchen lokale Kulturgutscheine, um den Konsum anzukurbeln, und eine europäische Sozialgarantie für Künstlerinnen und Künstler. 
Wer das Vermächtnis eines toten Künstlers bejubelt, aber den Lebenden in solch einer Krise nicht umfassend hilft, der hat die Verachtung aller Künstler verdient.

I think we have all seen that we needed to take very swift measures in order to help the regions, and I think we did so very well by using three one and two, or three one and plus. But now I think we are in a different stage and we need to follow a good procedure in order to help the most. This procedure, as always, is to evaluate the previous measures, define what we want to achieve and then rethink how we achieve it the best. Therefore I have questions for you. For the evaluation, we know that 60 regions have already applied to change to amend the operative programme and therefore we want to see is there a correlation between those who are using the flexibility measures and those regions affected most by COVID. Are these measures that we have taken actually using them, helping them? 
My second question: when we want to achieve something for the future we need to take a strategic approach, and therefore I want to ask you, how can we define a strategic approach and how can we ensure it then in REACT-EU, to actually have the strategic approach where I think less flexibility and more – sorry I’m missing the words here – but you know what I mean, that this is needed, very much.

I do sense the underlying spirit of a social just transition. People take centre stage and not companies, also a clear ‘no’ for subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power is just what the future needs.
This proposal for a JTF is a good starting point to help particular regions to cope with the transition. However, what I’m missing in the proposal is a clear commitment to European level climate targets. The people and the economy need a clear date when the last European coal plant will get off the grid. We need commitments by every single region to individual coal phase-out plans.
This must be a binding condition in order to receive support from the JTF, because funding a transition without the actual happening of a transition is pointless. And of course we have to talk about the money: EUR 7.5 billion, seven years, 108 coal regions. This roughly comes down to 10 million per region, per year. Is that enough to make the transition just for everyone?
And in your calculation you then add co-financing from other cohesion funds. But this can be very dangerous because we don’t want to shift money from one region in need to another one in need. You then multiply the JTF with potential private investments, but Mr Timmermans please: we both know that there is not 100 billion in that just transition mechanism, but 7.5 billion.
When street magicians try to trick their audience in such a way, we call that a sleight of hand. I’m sure the Commission doesn’t want to be seen a street magicians. So please come clear and let us fight together for a better consistent funding from own EU resources, so that coal workers are not at the mercy of MFF negotiations every seven years. We can support this proposal, though, if it stands for a clear and just transition with concrete phase-out plans for all coal regions.

How to fulfill this duty? Well the last weeks have proven that once again one of the solutions is tackling climate change.
What we do not need now is this religious-like belief that future technology will save us, is this bullshitting around of denying climate change or this useless discussion about what to do. We know what to do: stop coal until 2030; implement an ETS that covers all sectors with a limited amount of certificates; introduce additional carbon taxes on transport and travel; establish a border adjustment and use all the revenues for climate research adaptation and mitigation. But what we also need is more money to save our European culture. I call for a fund for the salvation of heritage sites with special significance for our common European history. We must protect our background, but also invest in a common cultural future or, as Robert Schuman put it in 1951, ‘much more than an economic alliance, Europe has to become a cultural union’.
