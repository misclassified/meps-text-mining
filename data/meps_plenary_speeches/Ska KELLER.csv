The rest of the shark body is being sold off for stuff that not necessarily everyone wants to eat. And the fins are the stuff that makes the profit from being exported to Asia. And also many shark fins are going through the European Union. So we clearly have a problem that is not yet addressed by the existing and very good legislation. We need to act and we need to act soon.
Clearly, selling shark fins is not about stopping anyone from starving. Shark fins are a luxury good and they cause the shark numbers to decline. Already now, 40% of all shark species are threatened. So we need to cut the incentive here. And in the committee hearing with the representatives of the citizens, an overwhelming majority of colleagues across the board was supporting this initiative. Unfortunately, it seems that some colleagues didn’t take the time back then to talk with the citizens that were there. So I urge the Commission, the Commissioner, to come forward with a proposal that honours the more than 1 million citizens’ requests from all Member States.

Ska KELLER,2023-05-11,EN,Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient fisheries - Agreement of the IGC on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (High Seas Treaty) (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-11-INT-4-045-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear colleagues, the oceans are important for their biodiversity, for providing the oxygen that we breathe, for the food that we eat, for their role as a carbon sink – on which we depend – and for the mysteries that the deep sea still holds for us. That’s more than enough reason to protect them, because without healthy oceans, we humans cannot exist, and I’m afraid we very often forget that.
The oceans are not just a resource to be plundered, a resource that will be endlessly there for us. That is unfortunately not the case. The oceans are at their limits and if not beyond their limits already. And before we point fingers at other countries far away or whatnot, we need to do our homework here inside the European Union, in the high seas and also in the more coastal waters. Because all of the problems – overfishing, waste dumping, fertilisers and pesticides flowing into the ocean – all of that happens also here in Europe as well as elsewhere. This needs to change.
Protecting the seas starts at home, not with empty promises, but with real action, with more and truly protected areas, better control of fisheries and an end to plastic waste and the reform of agriculture. We know what to do, but we need to do it, and if we don’t have the political will to do it, we will all suffer the consequences.

Ska KELLER,2022-10-20,EN,Commission implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1614 of 15 September 2022 determining the existing deep-sea fishing areas and establishing a list of areas where vulnerable marine ecosystems are known to occur or are likely to occur (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-20-INT-4-060-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, the deep sea is still a mystery to us. We know more about the surface of the moon than about the bottom of the ocean. Yet we are already wrecking this unknown and delicate place with waste and with fishing gear. Bottom trawling destroys everything on the sea floor, no matter whether it will be used later or not. And this has to stop. 
Already in 2016, we adopted the Deep-Sea Regulation which called for more protection, and only now the Commission is moving forward to truly preserve vulnerable marine life in the deep sea. This is a move we should welcome and not complain about. The Commission is simply doing its job to protect marine biodiversity and implementing decisions that we have voted for. 
It is high time we prioritised nature protection because the biodiversity crisis will not go away if we write legislation that we don’t put into practice. And we also have to stop thinking about nature protection and fisheries as being on opposite sides. Nature protection benefits fishers in the long run. We need to move away from fishing methods that have been proven to harm the seabed and delicate marine ecosystems. 
It is time we invested our resources into more sustainable fishing methods. That is how we get a resilient fisheries sector and how we make space for the new generations that want to be part of this sector. With the implementing act, only 1.16% of EU waters in the north-east Atlantic will be newly protected. That is very little given how much the oceans do for us. We need more, not less, protected areas because our lives depend on it.

Ska KELLER,2022-09-14,EN,State of the Union (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-09-14-INT-3-015-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, dear Commission President and dear Ms Zelenska, it is a big honour to have you here with us today and your presence reminds us that while we talk a lot about the problems that we’re facing in the EU, the real consequences of this war of aggression of Putin are carried by the people in Ukraine. A brutal invasion led against the peaceful people of Ukraine simply because they chose to live in freedom and democracy. Putin cannot live with the fact that people live in liberty with human and civil rights and that nations work together peacefully. Freedom and democracy – principles the EU was founded on – are the biggest threats to him.
All together, we must face this atrocious aggression with determination and with courage, just as Ukraine is showing us. Europe needs to support and continue to support Ukraine in their fight for peace and self-determination and even scale up those efforts. The past days have shown that the Ukrainian people are able to resist the attack. And it is now that Europe needs to stand by their side, by your side.
While Ukraine suffers most from the attack, there are also consequences for the EU. We must be prepared for tough times ahead. To do that, we must show solidarity to the outside but also to the inside by ensuring that the costs and consequences are carried by the stronger shoulders in our society. With skyrocketing energy and food prices, we must act. We know that many citizens in our Union are fearful of what the winter will bring. Fearful of being unable to heat their homes, feed their children, pay their bills. We cannot turn a blind eye to the situation of the most vulnerable people in our Union. Already now, every fifth person in the EU lives in poverty, and the scale of the increase in prices means that many more households will be at risk. It is our duty to ensure that people who are struggling get support and that the greed and profits of a few don’t lead to the misery of many.
So let’s take bold policy steps to make sure that everyone gets through these tough times. And I welcome the Commission President’s proposal to skim off windfall profits from energy companies, something that we as the Greens/EFA Group have been calling for since the beginning of this crisis.
The only true way to end our energy dependency is, on the one hand, to use less energy and, on the other hand, to produce more renewable energy. Sun and wind provide us with much more power than we could ever possibly use. So let’s profit from that. Fossil fuels have been a driver for ecological disaster and for dangerous dependency. Renewables are the true catalyst for peace, security and stability. Now is the time to scale up investments in renewables, to put solar panels on every roof, insulate buildings, and make sure sun and wind carry us into a new era of sustainable and affordable European energy production.
And let’s make no mistake, Commission President and colleagues, the climate crisis is probably the biggest political test for our generation. All over Europe, we experience the devastation the climate crisis is bringing and will bring to our continent and to the world. This summer, massive droughts and heatwaves paved the way for wildfires, killing a substantial amount of our harvest as well, and led to thousands of deaths that came prematurely. The cost of non-action is immense. It is time to act and to quickly build a brighter, cleaner future to capitalise on the enormous potential that the green transition brings in terms of sustainable economic development, well-paying and future-proofed jobs, cleaner air and a better quality of life for our citizens.
Dear colleagues, dear Commission President, Putin’s war against Ukraine is also targeted at our EU values and at democracy. In order to stand strong against opponents and threats, we have to defend those values within the EU and without exception. I am grateful for your strong words on the rule of law, Commission President, however, we have heard very promising words before. What we are lacking is action. Thanks to Parliament, we have instruments at hand, but now they need to be used, including the rule of law conditionality mechanism. Dear Commission President, please respect the conditionality instrument and the political will of this Parliament. No money should be given to the governments of Poland and Hungary unless they clearly return to the path of rule of law.
And I want to tell our dear colleagues from the EPP and especially you, Mr Weber, to be careful with whom we form partnerships. Looking at Italy, you are playing a risky game, with democracy and with our shared values, just for power. A game that could backfire on all of us. A group that claims to be part of the democratic majority should not partner with people who wear Putin-fancier shirts nor parties with fascist logos. Not in Italy, not in Spain, not in Sweden. Not in the EPP. Nowhere and never. And, it is a bit awkward that I say this as a Green, but the centre right has a very important role to play in Europe and part of this, together with all of us, is to ward off the extreme right. If you open the door to them, you are doing a big, big disservice to Europe but I believe also to your own party.
Dear Commission President and dear colleagues, yes, the state of the Union is full of challenges stemming from the war in Ukraine to the rule of law to the climate crisis. We are facing a big test. However, I am convinced that the EU has the strength to face these challenges if we work together. Work together towards new energy independence, a climate-neutral continent and, maybe most importantly, a European Union that deserves and maintains the trust of our European citizens, founded on values, founded on solidarity.

And yes, Europe is a vital part of the solution’. 
And for that, we need action now from the Commission, from the Council and from this House. One opportunity lies just ahead of you with the vote on renewables and on energy efficiency, and I hope we will do the right thing.

The war Russia is raging against Ukraine, is also one against European values and is also one against European integration. And as a European family, we need to stand together. 
Ukraine and Moldova have made important steps and reforms, notably against corruption. Not all is well – much remains to be done – but the progress is there and it will be given new impetus also with a candidate status. 
Georgia, too, has European ambition that we want to support. And I would strongly encourage the Georgian Government not to undermine the country’s past progress and to go forward making the necessary reforms. 
Apart from those three countries, we also need to see a clear commitment and perspective for the Western Balkans. These countries have all been waiting for years for any sort of progress in their accession perspective. Many have made enormous reforms – North Macedonia even changed its name – but are still being held in limbo and this must finally come to an end. We need a clear and reliable path to the EU for the Western Balkans for their own sake, but also for the growth and the strength of our Union. 
While the countries joining have to undertake the tough task to implement reforms, it’s not only their job – the EU needs to grow with this challenge and do everything in its power to unite the Union’s family and to stand up for our values. Let us not let this opportunity slip away. 
And what Ukraine has reminded us is how much drive and how much passion is behind the way towards European membership, how much energy this perspective for the future involves, how much it lifts people’s spirits. 
Too often we who have managed to join this Union forget about this kind of passion, forget about this power of hope that it holds. Let us use this moment as an opportunity to bring new life into the accession process. There is much at stake, but there is also so much to win.

Ska KELLER,2022-04-06,EN,Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 24-25 March 2022: including the latest developments of the war against Ukraine and the EU sanctions against Russia and their implementation (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-06-INT-3-017-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, we are all shocked by the atrocities that Russia is committing in Ukraine. The images, the testimonies of the survivors, they are unbearable. But we must not remain paralysed. There can be no questions. These more crimes cannot remain without reaction. We must take action and respond with further sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s criminal regime. Europe’s answer must be decisive and united. We need to continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to defend its freedom, including comprehensive and immediate financial assistance. And we must ensure that those who are responsible for those atrocious acts will be prosecuted and held accountable in front of the International Criminal Court. Injustice cannot and must not prevail. 
Dear colleagues, the war in Ukraine revealed Europe’s strategic mistakes in the past. Even after the atrocities done in Grozny and in Syria, very similar to what we see today in Bucha, even after Putin invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, some governments continued to hope for good business with Russia and made us more and more dependent on goods from Russia, on energy and on other items. And this has led us today to a situation where we are struggling to free ourselves from the short—sighted dependence on fossil fuels and uranium. 
Many mistakes were made, and now we need to make things right. We need to invest heavily in renewables and transition faster than we ever thought. This is, and will be, an enormous effort, and it won’t happen overnight. But we need to redefine what it means to act as fast as possible. We need to move to light speed. We need to save energy. Therein lies the huge potential that remains untapped so far. And this is true for individuals, sure, but also and even more so for industries and for policies –and the European Parliament must join efforts here as well. 
We also need to recognise that while the effects of the war will hit all of us, they hit us very differently. The biggest cost is obviously carried by the people who have lived and who still live in Ukraine. Those who died, whose close ones were killed, those who were injured and are being injured at the moment, those who fled and those who are fleeing the carnage, losing their home, their life plans, and often leaving family and friends behind. There is so much sorrow and so much despair in this suffering. 
When we are debating here the consequences of sanctions that we are rightfully taking, we need to keep in mind that us here in the Chamber are not the ones who will be most hit by them. Rising energy costs are a nuisance to some and an existential threat to others. We need to support those most in need – the families with small or no income. The European Council hasn’t been very conclusive on the issues of how to support those most in need in the EU and worldwide, looking at the hunger issues, and how to further support Ukraine. 
Of course, many of the instruments needed are indeed national ones, but it is clear that we need solidarity among Member States to deal with this crisis – solidarity in sharing energy and infrastructure, solidarity to enable measures, solidarity with everyone fleeing Ukraine, and solidarity with the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Putin wants to divide us and he has failed miserably. Our unity is our strength, and we need more of it – of unity, but also of courage.

Ska KELLER,2022-03-23,EN,Debriefing of the European Council meeting in Paris on 10 March 2022 - Preparation of the European Council meeting 24-25 March 2022 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-23-INT-1-050-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, Putin has brought back the horrors of war to Europe, and a cruel reminder of those horrors of the past and present is the violent death of World War Two Nazi concentration camp survivor, Boris Romanchenko, who was killed last week in the shelling of his apartment in Kharkiv. Our condolences go out to his family and friends, and to all Ukrainians who have lost loved ones in this senseless war. 
Millions of people have had to flee from Ukraine. Women, who still a month ago were building their careers, are now homeless. Children who were surrounded by their friends at their last birthday party now hold onto their pets as their only friends left. Students who are studying for their final exams are now stranded and old couples who maybe used to sit in street cafes, watching passers-by, now sit for days in overcrowded trains, hoping to arrive somewhere safe, and yet they have nowhere to go.
In this war, as in so many others, lives have been disrupted from one day to the next and people have been left shattered and scattered. The suffering of those refugees is immense, but there is also immense solidarity among Europeans who give donations, hand out food and even open their homes for those people in need. I want to thank those volunteers wholeheartedly. You are showing what Europe is about. You are showing what humanity is about. 
Member States have eased access at the borders and are setting up housing capacities. This solidarity is important and it is outstanding, but we need to speed up and we need to redouble those efforts. We need to redouble them and we need to protect people without discrimination. 
As always, it’s the countries that are in close geographic proximity that take the biggest inflows, but we all need to share together as Europeans, as European Member States, we need to share this effort of housing refugees among Member States, of registration and supporting those in need. We cannot expect a few countries alone to shoulder this immense task. All Member States have to do their share and they have to do it in the long run. 
Unfortunately, many more people will probably have to leave their home or their temporary shelter in western Ukraine. The least we can do is to offer them a safe shelter, and that safe shelter needs to be organised now. 
Let us not wait until we are sitting in a situation where we don’t know what to do next. Let us prepare. We know what to do. We know that we need to be prepared. So everyone, every single Member State, needs to make the efforts to make sure that those people who are traumatised by the war will finally find a place to rest and to live in safety.

Ska KELLER,2022-03-09,EN,"Debate with the Prime Minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas - The EU's role in a changing world and the security situation of Europe following the Russian aggression and invasion of Ukraine (debate)",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-081-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, the war Putin is waging is targeted against Ukraine, shelling civilian areas and attacking refugees, but his war is also meant against Europe as a whole.
Putin intends to destroy the post—Cold War European security architecture. Putin is waging a war against democracy, rule of law and freedoms, which are universal values. As the European Union, as the Union built for peace, we must act for the European security.
At European level, we need to make sure that the Member States’ defence is functioning, that investments are compatible with one another, that pooling and sharing finally gets implemented, and that we have common standards so equipment cannot be used by one State alone.
But colleagues, if we are exclusively thinking about the army when saying defence and security, then we don’t see the whole picture. Security means much more. It means energy security and energy independence. We need to get rid of the dependence on Russia’s fossil fuels and raw materials – be it gas, oil, coal or uranium. We have plenty of sun and wind to use on our own. We have the technology at hand. We need to reduce our consumption and speed up Fit for 55, investing massively in renewables, in energy efficiency and in energy saving.
Security also means civil protection. In the last years and decades, much of the protective infrastructure in Europe has been neglected. Floods and wildfires in recent years have already shown us the lack of preparedness. The EU and its Member States need to urgently work on how to effectively protect citizens.
Security also means making sure that Europe’s critical infrastructure is well—functioning, well—stocked and in public hands. The same goes for cybersecurity and our digital infrastructure and data. We need to talk about resilient societies, about communities that help each other and are educated to withstand misinformation campaigns and to spot fake news.
Security for Europe means solidarity among Member States, about sharing the efforts, for example, for welcoming the many people fleeing Ukraine. They need to be housed, they need medical care, the children need to go to school, and that will need a shared effort by all Member States and not just a few. We have seen it in the last two weeks. When we act together, we are strong. This is the lesson that we have to carry forward.

Ska KELLER,2022-03-08,EN,International Women’s Day – Address by Oksana Zabuzhko,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-08-INT-2-103-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, we have made advances for gender equality, but the pure fact that I stand here today, as a female politician and the President of my Group, and the fact that we have a female President of the Parliament, is unfortunately nothing to be taken for granted. It is the result of the incredible work of the many women before us who fought for equal rights and for gender equality. With that in mind, today becomes more than a celebration of women’s rights. It becomes a reminder of the hard work that we need to put in for women’s rights, a reminder of how much equality we’re still missing. 
In times of war, women are one of the most vulnerable groups, threatened by gender—based violence, fleeing conflict zones under horrible conditions and at high risk of human trafficking, while often being excluded from the formal negotiations to end the conflicts that they are suffering from. The idea of feminism is about creating a fair world, a world in which we can live freely, equally and in peace. 
In the last two weeks, we have seen these ideals demonstrated by the brave women of Ukraine doing everything in their power to keep their families and their communities safe. I also want to stress that we see all the efforts of women in Russia and in Belarus protesting to show they disagree with this horrific war of Putin’s, who is waging it against Ukraine, all the while not forgetting the efforts and the suffering of women in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and so many other conflicts in the world. 
These women show us what courage and resilience look like, and this is the courage that we lose when women are not involved in the decision—making processes. Experience shows that, when women are part of the decision—making and peace-making efforts, the resulting peace is longer lasting and more broadly carried by society because diverse perspectives and additional knowledge are included. 
It is our joint responsibility to make sure that women around the world receive equal opportunities to get their feet in the door and take their rightful place at the table. Feminism is the key to a more equal and more peaceful world, not just for women, but for all of us and for the generations to come.

A country that just as any other country wants to decide on its own future but is bullied by its big neighbour. But this is not just a threat to Ukraine. It’s also an attack on the basic idea of how states relate to each other. It’s a threat to international rules and to European security. And it saddens me profoundly that we have to debate this dangerous development in our Eastern Neighbourhood today. 
This European Parliament was born out of the devastating experience of war and violence. The EU was built as a peace project and a model of democratic cooperation. President Putin’s nationalist and imperial course of action and suppression runs contrary to the mere idea of our common Union. Putin’s actions therefore challenge us as Europeans, and we as Members of this Parliament, carry a historic responsibility to stand up and clearly condemn Russia’s threats of aggression.
As the EU, as its Parliament, we stand united against the Russian threat and in full support with Ukraine. The people of Ukraine have our support for choosing their own path for living in peace and for undertaking reforms that will transform their country for the better. 
We need to be prepared for sanctions against individuals, entities and sectors in Russia. I am talking, for example, about freezing assets, about entry bans, and yes, I am also talking about Nord Stream 2. This pipeline must be part of our common sanction regime. And yes, sanctions have repercussions, also for ourselves, but we must act in face of an aggression.
As a Union we need to reduce our dependency on Russia, especially when it comes to energy. We have the technologies to do so and we have ample supplies of sun and wind. What energy we use is a geo-strategic decision. And we need to make the right one. 
Let’s not forget that the Ukrainian people have suffered greatly already because of the Russian aggression going on for years in eastern Ukraine. Almost 15 000 people have died. More than a million Ukrainians had to flee their homes. Conflicts can only be solved by diplomatic means. Russia must withdraw its troops and end the threat of invasion. It must return to the table of frank and peaceful negotiations. Negotiations that must be based on international law, mutual respect and a common vision for peace on our common European continent.
This is a key moment for international peace, stability and security. Now is our time to show through words and through actions that we stand united as one, and that the people of Ukraine can count on us.

And as it always is with family members, they leave a painful void – a void that will be felt in this Parliament for a very long time. 
President Sassoli was a committed, heartfelt pro-European. He carried a deep conviction that Europe’s future could only be ensured by working together, by overcoming the borders of the past. He leaves us a big legacy and it is up to us now to continue on this path. His conviction and passion for Europe is our guidance for the future. 
In his political life, President Sassoli could always rely on the power of the better argument. He was a man of political discussions striving to change people’s minds and convictions with the power of words. And thanks to his visions, humour and his compassion, he was able to connect with people and build lasting ties. 
In the current political climate that is so often shaped by polarisation and antagonism, he was able to build bridges and bring people together. He was, in that sense, a politician of the best kind and the best ambassador for our democratic House. 
President Sassoli and I saw eye-to-eye on many big challenges that our continent is facing today – be it on climate change or on the need for a truly social Europe. It was, however, his continuous battle against the humanitarian disaster of people suffering and dying at EU borders that brought us together the most. 
I will always honour David for his very clear words and deeply human approach. He impressed me as he did not shy away when the call for rescuing people at sea was far from popular, while he was convinced it is a human duty.
Dear Members of this House, we have lost a most distinguished colleague and a great European politician. My deeply felt condolences go to the family of David, who have lost so much more. David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament, will be missed deeply and he will not be forgotten.

Europe is even becoming a hotspot in the global statistics.
And yes, there are differences between Member States. But we should never stop to look for European solutions, to learn from one another, and we should make sure that the virus that has caused so much damage never gets in the way of our united Europe.
The Member States need to make a greater effort to get people vaccinated also, with booster shots, to prevent the overburdening of the health system and to protect the people who cannot be vaccinated yet, like most children.
This crisis is not over yet, and it will not help to pretend otherwise. We should not forget that many regions of the world don’t even have access to enough vaccines, and this needs to change, or we will never see the end of the pandemic.
In preparation for the summit, we had discussed the issue of the rule of law, and I was indeed very happy that several presidents and prime ministers were very vocal on rule of law in the media. However, it seems that the Council did not reach any progress.
And it’s not only – also, but not only – the task of the Commission to act, but also of the Member States. The Article 7 procedure is in the hands of the Council and yet, nothing is moving. We need more action and we need it fast. This only becomes a crisis if we don’t act.
Speaking of another crisis, the climate summit in Glasgow has brought about progress, but it’s the bitter reality that this progress is absolutely insufficient in the wake of a catastrophic climate crisis. And there is no time for self—congratulatory statements. The urgency is real.
Europe needs to step up its game, and it’s not helped by branding fossil investments as sustainable. Investments in gas now will mean prolonging the fossil era for decades, instead of finally getting real with climate protection. And nuclear is neither safe nor clean, and certainly not renewable. We desperately need a sustainable energy transition, and we cannot waste our time on gas and nuclear.
And finally, on Belarus: as long as we see human beings as the biggest threat, we give Belarus and also other regimes all leverage. We have to help those people in need. They are stuck, and they are not weapons; they are people in need.

He has degraded MEPs. He has promoted ridiculous conspiracy theories and he has used anti-Semitic stereotypes. 
I’m not willing to get used to this kind of political rhetoric. It undermines our democracies and we must call it out for what it is – dangerous populism. I’m happy to hear, Minister, that you’re going to discuss disinformation at the Council, so I’m sure you can bring it up, or your Prime Minister obviously can bring it up here. 
We have seen that democratic values can never be taken for granted, must always be defended, and I am proud to know that my Group, but also the majority of this House will agree with me when I say that.
Yesterday we debated the situation in Poland, a country that is turning its back on the EU, even though one should always keep in mind that it’s not the country, which has a huge support for the European Union, it is the government that is turning the country’s back on the EU and its values. And we called on the Commission yesterday to take strong actions in defence of our Treaties. But the truth is that the Council also has a role to play. 
In the Council there are some around the table who blatantly violate the most fundamental of our common rules. So I wonder, will the prime ministers and presidents finally, and in all clarity, speak up to them? Will the Council start finally the hearings on Article 7? Because the real crisis for our Union is when there is no strong response when some deviate from our common values. 
I would also like to hear some clear words from Council members on the human rights crisis at the European borders. People are dying at our borders because of our lack of action. They are being pushed back at the borders, beaten, humiliated, left helpless, and yet no one seems to care. And this needs to stop. 
Europe’s borders and what happens there are our common responsibility. That the human rights of people in need are systematically violated cannot be an acceptable state of play. Human beings are not weapons. They are not threats. Right now, every dictator in the world has understood that the one thing that the Europeans are very much afraid of is to send children, women and men. If they want to put pressure on us, that’s what they will do. But rather than being frightened, we should finally establish a fair asylum system based on human rights and solidarity. And this Parliament has again and again proven to be ready. 
And Europe also needs to reduce its dependency on autocrats when it comes to energy. Instead of building infrastructure that will tie us forever to the goodwill of not necessarily well-meaning governments, we need to invest in renewable energy at home to help the climate, but also to tackle energy poverty. It is a big problem all over Europe. We have the means to solve it. We have done, unfortunately, all over Europe, too little for too long and this must change.

Maybe we should give him the extra time for that, President. I believe, Prime Minister, though, that you are leading your country on a dangerous path, a path which calls into question the country’s well-deserved place at the heart of the European Union.
I remember very well the day that Poland joined the European Union. It was just such a joyful day, such a day full of hope of overcoming very physical borders, but also the borders in our head. Today, it pains me to see how your government undermines this very unity that we celebrated together. Your government has turned its back on the rule of law, on the independence of the judiciary, on minorities, on almost anyone who does not fit your reactionary ideology.
With this latest judgment, your government—chosen judges also turned their backs on the very principle of the EU itself ˗ the strength of our common laws. Let’s make no mistake, this does not just concern Poland. What the Polish Government has done and is doing is an attack on the very existence of the EU itself.
Our Union is not just an economic alignment; it’s a Union of peace, cooperation, democracy and the same rules applying to everyone. A Union where Member States have voluntarily agreed to submit to commonly found agreements in order to offer their citizens a better life, to overcome conflicts and to guarantee peace. The Polish Government has questioned those fundamental pillars. If we let that pass, then there won’t be much left of those pillars before long.
This is a test for all of us, but mostly for the European Commission. President von der Leyen, being the guardian of the treaties has never been an easy task, but this time is different. When a Member State blatantly questions the fundamentals, the Commission must act strongly and swiftly.
Time and time again, your Commission has extended a hand of dialogue to the Polish Government. But, President von der Leyen, the Polish Government has rejected your hand. It is now high time that you fulfil the obligations that the EU’s Treaty puts on you, to defend the citizens of Poland and to defend the core of the Union, a Union built on justice.

Prime Minister, you’ve been coming here more like a leader of a small party in a heated election campaign and I’m not sure that’s the image you want to give here. Where are your ideas of how to get out of this crisis? I haven’t heard any ideas about how you want to go forward, and that seems to be the road right into the abyss.
And I’m very proud of all our colleagues here across the room from Poland, who stood up today here for the rule of law in their own country, as well as the European Union overall. I’m very proud of you, colleagues. And let’s never forget that Poland is much more than peace. The Polish people deserve our solidarity, so let’s keep on working for the rule of law, and I very much hope that the Commission is going to be very strong, but also the Council indeed, and we’re going to debate that tomorrow, because they also have to do their job. All of us together. But that also includes the Polish Government.

Ska KELLER,2021-09-14,EN,Presentation of the Fit for 55 package after the publication of the IPCC report (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-09-14-INT-2-013-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, this summer the UN Panel on Climate Change gave us a dramatic reminder of what’s at stake. They tell us the global surface temperature is increasing faster than ever in the past 2 000 years. They tell us that if we don’t drastically limit our emissions, every single region on our planet will suffer the immediate consequences of climate change. They tell us we only have until 2030 maximum to do everything in our power to act against the climate and biodiversity crisis. 
The decisions that we are taking today have to deliver on the global promise to keep the temperature rise well below two degrees, and it’s the industrialised countries that have built their wealth on greenhouse gas emissions that are now threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the globe. We, as Europeans, have a special responsibility, and all of this makes the Fit for 55 package so important. A 55% reduction is, anyway, not very ambitious given the challenge ahead. Therefore, it will be even more important that this package is filled with concrete measures that are correctly and honestly calculated and measures that start today and not just only after 2030. And unfortunately, that is a test that this package does not pass, at least not in all aspects. 
Phasing out free allowances in the emission trade, a kerosene tax and an end to the combustion engine cannot be postponed for another 10 years, or even more. Not only are we losing out in the fight to keep the climate conditions liveable, but also in the race for who provides the tools and technology for the transition. 
The time to act is now if we don’t want to drown in the consequences of our own inaction. Rather, we need to end public subsidies for fossil fuel, get rid of free pollution certificates, complement the renovation phase with the solar phase and accelerate the switch to renewables. We know what to do. We just need to do it, and we have no time to lose.

Ska KELLER,2021-07-06,EN,Presentation of the programme of activities of the Slovenian Presidency (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-07-06-INT-2-016-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, an ever—accelerating climate crisis, the deterioration of the rule of law in Europe, a new turn in the pandemic with a very transmissible variant spreading: these are just some of the issues a new Presidency will have to face, and it will be more than enough for any. 
But we are concerned about how willing the Slovenian Presidency is to take on those challenges. While we see unprecedented heatwaves and while the ocean is literally on fire, your Presidency will be in a position to start the negotiations on the climate package. You have a historic chance to help upgrade the EU’s position from the recent insufficient climate targets and focus on a massive rollout of a green and socially just transition.
In your Presidency’s priorities, however – and you mentioned exactly that just now in your speech – not only is such an ambition lacking, but you are even giving credit to false solutions. On the rule of law, Prime Minister Janša, you seem to have been following and taking a look into a course on illiberal democracy, and that is dangerous for the European values your Presidency is claiming to uphold. Smear campaigns and the intimidation of free media and civil society, and looking for scapegoats are not the acts we expect from a European government. 
You have said that your Presidency’s number one priority is resilience and recovery, and I think we both agree that the key to achieve this is a good and targeted use of the common European funds dedicated to the recovery that we so dearly need. I am therefore wondering, as are colleagues, why Slovenia is the only country in the entire European Union that has not yet nominated its prosecutors to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. What is the message that you are sending by interfering with judicial nominations? You’ve just said how important judicial independence is. Interfering with judicial nominations that are supposed to shed light on fraudulent use of public money in our union is rather strange to me with the rule of law being one of the priorities that you have set. 
The Presidency is always a time when a country and its government are in the limelight. While a country as beautiful as Slovenia always deserves to be the spot of attention, I do have some doubts about how you and your government will represent the EU in the next six months. But I hope that you will prove me, and us, wrong. We are very much looking forward to cooperating with you because a successful presidency is indeed a success for the whole European Union, but it needs to be based on the common values and targets that we have all agreed and signed up to.

Ska KELLER,2021-06-09,EN,Conclusions of the special meeting of the European Council on 24 and 25 May 2021 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-06-09-INT-3-019-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, let’s start with the positive news from the last summit. There was indeed unified and strong condemnation of Belarus kidnapping a plane, and arresting and torturing two of its citizens. It’s good that sanctions were agreed; it’s good that they came swiftly. It was a truly outrageous action by Lukashenko and it cannot go unanswered. 
The EU must be ready to think about further sanctions and to work tirelessly for the release of all political prisoners. We must also step up our support to independent civil society, journalists and peaceful political actors in Belarus and ensure that those fighting and risking their lives for democracy find support and protection in the European Union. 
The less good news is actually old news. The Council continues, unfortunately, to ignore the climate emergency and once again fell far short of agreeing anything close to the scale of action needed to protect our climate. It is ironic that the Council is welcoming the United States’ commitment to the Paris Agreement and urges increased global action, while at the same time is stepping on the brake on climate targets and on concrete measures. I’m sure there were a lot of preoccupations; I’m sure not many of them were about the climate emergency. We expect more and better of you. Going into the COP26 in Glasgow, if the EU is to have any credibility and leverage to demand more climate action globally, the level of commitment from the EU side needs to be significantly stepped up. 
The Council also debated the situation of the pandemic, and in Europe the numbers indeed look promising and the vaccination efforts are finally picking up, and that’s great – although we should not forget that there is also a significant difference still between members in their vaccination campaigns. But however well we might be doing in Europe, we should never forget that many countries globally hardly have any access to vaccines. This is a new gap in global justice, threatening the lives and destroying the livelihoods of many, while also leaving the door open to any variant, which can bring new spirals of problems worldwide. 
So the slogan of ‘No one is safe until everyone is safe’ finally needs to be filled with life. Donations of financial means and vaccines are extremely welcome, but they are also not enough. Production needs to be ramped up, and one tool to bring this forward is a temporary TRIPS waiver, with compulsory licensing for countries of the global south and knowledge—sharing that will boost global vaccine production. 
I think the EU must finally ‘walk its talk’ and provide global leadership in all of those fields, and the G7 summit will be one possibility for that. Beyond the nice speeches, the EU must do more. It’s what the world expects of the EU, but it’s also what Europeans expect of their leaders – and that’s where we will be holding you accountable.

Ska KELLER,2021-04-26,EN,Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 25 and 26 March 2021 - The outcome of the high level meeting between the EU and Turkey of the 6th of April (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-04-26-INT-1-039-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to say to you, President Michel, that I am disappointed in you. I don’t expect much from President Erdoğan. He has just cancelled the Istanbul Convention and does nothing to protect women – to put it very mildly – and certainly he would try to divide the EU, but from you I would have expected different. If you treat the Commission President like this, then no woman can expect different treatment, and that’s what makes it so personal. 
The EU can only speak with a strong voice if we speak with one voice, if we’re not divided, and this is of course very well known to President Erdoğan but also to other heads of state elsewhere. That’s exactly why they try so hard to divide us and we should never play their game because it weakens all of us. 
Already before your visit to Turkey the EU position towards the Turkish Government has been very weak, and that is something that I’m disappointed with in everyone participating in that meeting. 
The human rights situation in Turkey is catastrophic and democracy and the rule of law have deteriorated dramatically. Look no further than the arbitrary imprisonment of journalists, academia, opposition politicians, the ceaseless harassment of civil society, media, opposition parties, doctors, lawyers, prosecutors, people facing many years of prison for tweets, like Cihan Erdal, and women, especially trans—woman, facing massive violence. 
And yet, confronted with all of those issues, the Council is still working on a mandate for the modernisation of the customs union between the EU and Turkey without any linkage to human rights and – very differently from accession negotiations – upgrading the customs union entails zero commitment for press freedom or the rights of opposition parties. It’s a purely economic instrument that will help Erdoğan win in the area that makes him most vulnerable – economics. 
Therefore, I strongly urge you to think again about the message you are sending to people fighting for human rights and democracy in Turkey, but also beyond. And yes, European companies would also benefit from the customs union upgrade, but that cannot be an argument to ignore human rights. You must change track now for Europe to have any foreign policy credibility left.
Turkey is one of the main receiving countries for refugees, and yes we should do our utmost to help the country deal with that challenge, but Europe should never have tasked Erdoğan with keeping people in need away from Europe’s borders. That was a failure of Europe’s responsibility to the fundamental human rights of people in need of protection and a geopolitical disaster, and it needs to be ended and not to be continued.

They were the direct result of Trump egging them on, but also of four years of daily lies, a contempt for facts, of relentless attacks on free media and portraying dissenting opinion as evil or a conspiracy. And this proves that even the strongest democracies are vulnerable when challenged on a steady and aggressive basis. I very much hope that the inauguration today goes well and smoothly, and I wish President Biden a lot of success.
Dear colleagues, imagine that the riots to overturn a free and fair election would have happened here at the European Parliament or in the parliament of one of the Member States. Sounds unbelievable, sounds far away? But do we really think in Europe we are safe from the threats of populism and demagogues, from disinformation and attacks to overthrow the rule of law? Remember the Brexit campaign five years ago, filled with blatant lies and false promises. Think of the Polish Government’s unbelievable disregard for women’s ownership of their own bodies. Think of what we sometimes hear here in this Chamber. And perhaps most emblematic: don’t forget Viktor Orbán’s systematic dismantling of Hungary’s rule of law, blaming every imaginable or unimaginable foreign foe, from George Soros to migrants, to indeed the EU itself. And let’s keep all of this in mind when looking at the events across the Atlantic. Those events should inspire humbleness rather than fuel a false belief that we’re safe from all of this in the EU. We must learn from those shocking events in Washington.
Firstly, we should take seriously those who announce that they want to destroy democracy. Many participants in the Capitol riots had announced their intentions in plain view. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Far-right groups are also underestimated in Europe. They commit murders, they purchase weapons, and yet there’s very little attention to what they’re planning. They are a real threat, both on this side and on the other side of the Atlantic.
And secondly, let’s remember that democracies are fragile and are always ‘work in progress’, and the EU has not always been agile enough to prevent the erosion of rule of law in several Member States. We must relentlessly work to safeguard fundamental rights and rule of law.
And thirdly, we need to look into the role of the social media tech giants in this crisis. Disinformation, amplified by algorithms, has divided societies and has even cost human lives. At the same time, the cooperative executives have acquired unbelievable power. So let’s bring social media under democratic scrutiny. That can wait no longer.

Ska KELLER,2020-12-16,EN,"Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 10-11 December 2020 – MFF, Rule of Law Conditionality and Own Resources – Council regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 – Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources – Regulation on the protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States (debate)",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-12-16-INT-3-020-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear colleagues, it is good to see that, finally, at the 11th hour, the European Council has given its green light so that support for citizens and economies hit hard by the pandemic can finally start. Neither the European citizens and the economies which have been hard hit, nor the climate, could have waited any longer. But while it’s really good that those agreements have been reached, there are quite some worrying trends attached to each of the decisions, and the past weeks have seen a sad show of obstruction by the governments of Hungary and Poland, which have wanted to take the Recovery Fund hostage for their own anti—democratic agenda. 
Mr Orbán and Mr Kaczyński, you neither serve your citizens nor our common European future, and in the light of such blackmail we all need to stay and stand strong. And therefore it is really worrying to see the European Council’s attempt to interpret the political agreement and the law agreed by the European Parliament and the Council. That is highly problematic. 
Probably even more worrying is the Commission’s role in this affair. The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must reaffirm that its intention is to apply the legislation to the latter as agreed by the co—legislators and without any delay, and that also means not waiting for some judgments until some guidelines are drawn up. We have a law in place. It needs to be applied without delay – that is crucial. 
Coupled with the Presidency’s failure to organise a hearing on the Article 7 proceedings on Hungary, this really makes for a poor track record for the European Union in its tackling of systemic democratic regressions in the middle of our common Union. 
I want to stress again that the only law agreed is what Parliament and Council as co—legislators have decided previously. Nothing of that law has changed, nothing of that law will change, and it needs to be enforced as of 1 January 2021 for both the current and the upcoming MFF.
On Climate Action, I welcome the fact that the governments managed to strengthen the European 2030 emission reduction targets, though a net decrease of at least -55% is still far short of the scientific consensus which is needed (-65%). Parliament has made a strong mandate of a greenhouse gas emission of -60%, which we will continue to fight for in the upcoming weeks and months because, again, the law has been made according to the normal legislative procedure. However, the target agreed by the Council of a 55% reduction is not an absolute but a net target, which is extremely worrying. And yes, of course we must protect and restore land, forests and other ecosystems in our fight to reverse climate change, but this should never be compensation for lessening efforts by the biggest emitters. If the European Union is to be a global leader in fighting climate change, we will need to do more than just come up with some creative calculations. 
It’s regrettable that the European Council gave in to pressure from the usual suspects, I have to say, to endorse in its conclusions gas as a transitional fuel, which it is simply not. If we are to overcome the climate crisis, the future has to be completely fossil fuel-free. The exclusion of all fossil fuels from the Just Transition Fund was a clear signal and the European Council should have followed suit. We expect and we need more ambition to tackle the problems at hand and we need fewer double standards from the Heads of State and Government. I hope this will improve in the future and I count on our common normal legal proceedings in order to draw up a good climate law.
(Applause)

Ska KELLER,2020-11-25,EN,Preparation of the European Council meeting of 10-11 December 2020 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-11-25-INT-3-024-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, agreeing on the recovery fund was a truly big achievement of the Heads of State and Government back in July. It did need a lot of pushing from the European Parliament and not everything is ideal in that package, but this is still an unprecedented common effort to help citizens in an unprecedented crisis. It was - and is - a big step forward in European history. 
But now this big success is at risk because two governments only care about their own power and about staying in power because that’s, in the end, what the veto by the Hungarian and Polish Governments is all about. Like Trump, who is killing Corona support in the US, Orbán is doing the same in Europe. Blocking the recovery fund will be felt and shouldered by Hungarian and Polish citizens just as much as by any other Europeans. What a cynical disregard of the needs of one’s own citizens. And let’s not forget that there is no binary choice to be made. The recovery fund is essential to overcome this crisis, the MFF is essential to set the EU on the path to a Green Deal transformation, and equally, the rule of law framework is essential to ensure these EU funds serve the needs and best interests of European citizens. 
Dear Hungarian and Polish friends, your governments are gambling with your future. The European Union is founded on values such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law and this Parliament will never stop defending those values. For too long, many governments may not have been happy with straying away from democracy in some Member States, but they have never truly spoken out. That time is over. At this summit, it is time for everyone to take a stance.
Decisions are also needed at this summit to ensure that the EU takes serious climate action. At the last summit, any decision on the 2030 climate targets was postponed. Now governments must act. The European Parliament has delivered an ambitious target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by the year 2030, and the governments must now follow suit to allow for swift and decisive climate action. I also want to stress that we need to have an honest emission reduction target, not one with creative calculations and loopholes that might create pretty numbers on paper, but would fail in real life. The task is to preserve a liveable planet in all of its biodiversity and the measures must live up to this target.
With an extraordinary year coming to an end, we’re also running out of time to find any agreement with the UK. While we’re immensely sad that the UK will be leaving us, it is also clear that we cannot just simply agree to anything that comes up at the last minute. This Parliament needs time for scrutiny and for debating any possible agreement. As the Verts/ALE Group, we will not just sign off any deal. We will look very closely at whether this is an agreement that is of mutual benefit, that safeguards social and environmental standards and that does not endanger peace in Northern Ireland. We will not hesitate to defend those rights and standards for the benefit of European citizens, but also, we believe, for the benefit of British citizens, now and in the future if the UK decides to rejoin.

Trump is out, even if he himself doesn’t yet want to believe it. I’m sure he will see soon. Joe Biden and his promise of politics based on respect for each other, for facts, and for science has won. Kamala Harris, Vice President-elect, achieved something truly historic. A first woman, a woman of colour: Harris smashed many glass ceilings, and while a lot remains to be done on gender equality, this breakthrough will have a long-lasting impact. 
But, while Trump is voted out of the White House, Trumpism – or whatever you want to call this disastrous mix of nationalism, racism, and narcissism – got a lot of support. And it also has a lot of support in Europe and even among some EU governments, as we have seen. Democracy, equality and rule of law are not a given on either side of the Atlantic. It is something we have to strive for every day and never take for granted. Movements like Black Lives Matter, like Me Too, and journalists, democracy activists and many more fought back and defended democracy in the US for the past four years. They are the ones that should be celebrated in these elections. 
Transatlantic relations have taken a hard hit over the past four years, and while we all hope and we can be sure that they will become better now, the lesson learned for Europe is that it needs to stand more on its own two feet. In order to be able to do that, we need to also stand stronger together and more firmly. For that, we need to have a common understanding of fundamental values because if we don’t know on what grounds we stand as a Union then we cannot grow. And equally, we cannot shy away from the responsibilities of our actions in the external world. That goes for the climate crisis, for weapons exports, for conflict parties or for shady energy projects with even more shady partners such as Nord Stream. If we want Europe to be taken seriously by the world, we have to take ourselves seriously first, and that means taking responsibility for our actions and their impact in the world, no matter who rules the White House.

Ska KELLER,2020-10-21,EN,"Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 15 and 16 October 2020, in particular the negotiations of the future relations with the UK (debate)",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-10-21-INT-3-023-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, with regard to climate, those were very poor Council conclusions indeed. Or can I even call them conclusions, because the only thing that leaders could agree on was that they had actually talked about climate. We are in the midst of a rapidly progressing climate crisis and postponement of action is a mistake. This year again looks set to break any sort of records with regard to climate crisis, be it heat waves, droughts, intensity, extreme weather events, Arctic shield loss, etc. 
So, let me be very clear. Deciding to talk about climate later is failing to grasp the urgency of this task. We have to act now and we have to act decisively at all levels and also in all policy areas, and the compromise reached by the European Parliament on reducing greenhouse gases by 60% by 2030 is a good step forward. Some of you have said it’s an ambitious target, but it’s not so ambitious: it’s a more realistic target if we really want to save our planet. Member States should sign up to it quickly – to the 60% goal – so we can finally start acting. The climate doesn’t wait and neither should we. 
And yes, the economic transformation needed for that is no walk in the park, especially for regions with a long-standing tradition of carbon-intensive economies. That’s why the Parliament is insisting on having a proper-sized Just Transition Fund, among others, as part of a new EU budget, because you need to put the money where your policy targets is. You need to put the money where you want to have the EU fit for the tasks ahead and that requires adequate funding. Any government should know that. We need to have a climate spending target of 30% and a biodiversity target of 10% in order to be up to the tasks ahead. And EU funds also need to advance our Union values. That’s why compliance with rule of law must be an essential criteria for allocating the funds and these are critical elements in the Parliament’s position on the EU budget and recovery fund. It is just inadmissible that the Council disregards such fundamental concerns. 
As for Brexit, it’s very sad to see that so much time has passed without any agreement being reached on our future relations. We’re approaching the end of the time limit and I just want to remind us that of course the UK Government could have asked for an extension and they decided not to, but it’s also clear that we cannot accept a deal that would endanger the single market, social rights or environmental standards. So further work is needed on that and we are still extremely sad that Brexit was decided, but now we need to see that we also ensure the Union’s togetherness.
We are again holding this meeting under very exceptional circumstances. We’re in the midst of a big, big medical crisis. Let us learn from the EU response in the spring, let us now be more coordinated, more cohesive and make sure that border restrictions are avoided. It’s an exceptional year in many different ways and the Council needs to step up if it is ready to face these challenges.

Ska KELLER,2020-09-16,EN,State of the Union (topical debate) (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-09-16-INT-3-018-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the state of this Union today is defined by our failure at the external borders, by the fact that we let children sleep on the streets, that we refuse to give water to those in need, that we send police against those fleeing from war and violence and that we knowingly let people down and drown at sea. This is a very shameful state that we’re in.
It was exactly the historic experience of people suffering from war, destruction and displacement that motivated Europeans in the first place to build the EU. What a sad moment in our common history that we stand idle in the face of so much suffering on our doorstep. This shameful situation is our collective responsibility as Europeans. Greece has failed for many years to produce conditions in refugee camps that would at least be acceptable. Countries like the Netherlands and Austria told Greece not to allow refugees on the mainland and actively wanted to see terrible conditions in order that it might deter people fleeing from war and terror, and countries like Hungary refused to accept anyone in need. 
But it is also true that the EU itself has turned a blind eye, has not insisted and has given up hope. I urge you, Commission President, to take up the fight with the Member States, to make it a top priority to help people in need, and not to give in to this disastrous state we’re in. Let us demonstrate that we are courageous and that we’re wholeheartedly European, and we have demonstrated that we can be courageous and lead the way forward towards progress. Together, the European Union will mobilise the means and funds to counter the worst of the economic effects of the pandemic, proof that we can be a strong union indeed.
The agreement of July has a lot of shortcomings, but the signal of sticking together and finding a solution was very important. Now is the time to bring the Recovery Fund, as well as the long—term budget, into reality. Right now we set the standards for how we will spend the money and what we will spend it on. EU funds have to foster EU values and uphold the fundamentals of EU treaties. There can be no discount on the rule of law, not for Hungary, not for Poland, not for any other country. 
I want to thank you for your strong words on the rights of LGBTI people and I would like to ask you to follow up on those strong words with a measure that the Commission has in its hands, namely an infringement procedure, because zones free of the essence of humanity cannot be accepted. 
(Applause)
Public money should also not enhance the climate crisis. This sounds obvious, but unfortunately it is still the case that the EU budget subsidises fossil fuels. The common agricultural policy, as well as the trade policy, finally need to align with the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy. For the next seven years, we need a European climate budget. 
It is good to see, Commission President, that you have set out a new and higher emission reduction target of at least 55%. We welcome that and I’m sure there has been a lot of pressure to try to prevent you from doing so. These new targets are an important step forward, but any greenwashing with creative calculations would render them null and void. Even then, we know from a scientific point of view that at least -55% would not be enough. But luckily we have in this House in our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) a good climate law that has been prepared. I hope this will come to a conclusion soon as time is of the essence. The climate cannot be negotiated with so we’d better move fast. 
Let me finish by saluting the incredible courage that we see by the people in Belarus, who have demonstrated on the streets of the country in these weeks, especially the women. We see you, we see your wish for freedom, for democracy and to define your own future, and your courage is inspirational. From the freedom fighters in Belarus to the environmental activists in the Amazon, to the democracy protesters in Bulgaria, they are all looking at the European Union to uphold fundamental rights, to defend pluralism and to enforce the highest climate and environmental standards both in Europe and beyond. These are high standards to live by and it is up to all of us to make sure that we fulfil them.

Now we had the announcement of which we share many of them, but of course the important task is to put all of that into life, and I want to thank you for your strong words when it comes to human rights, be it on the human rights of refugees, of LGBTI people, also human rights in Russia and in China. The question is, what are the consequences of those words? How will we put them into action, into life, what action will follow? I think it’s very important to make sure that our policies are coherent so that we’re not exporting weapons and then are surprised about refugees, that were not subsidising fossil fuels and then wondering about climate change, and that we also don’t put profits over human rights when it comes to our external relations – and I’m thinking about relations with China, where there’s lots of important talks going on, but also, for example, when it comes to Russia. Thank you very much and good luck. We’re ready to support you.

(Applause) 
Es ist sicherlich ein Ort, wo man die Schwierigkeiten der Europäischen Union wahrnehmen kann, wo wir aber in einer sehr großen Mehrheit alle daran arbeiten, dieses Europa für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger besser zu machen – auch wenn wir uns manchmal darin unterscheiden, wie wir dahin kommen wollen und was das genau heißt –, und ein Ort, an dem wir noch härter daran arbeiten müssen, die Vielfalt der Europäischen Union besser zu repräsentieren – in diesem Haus.
Deutschland übernimmt die Ratspräsidentschaft in sehr schwierigen Zeiten. Denn die Corona-Krise ist auch für die gesamte Europäische Union zur historischen Prüfung geworden. Zu Beginn der Krise drohte die Union in nationale Einzelteile zu zerfallen: Schlagbäume waren zurück in Europa, das Vertrauen der Bürgerinnen und Bürger in das gemeinsame Europa hat dramatisch gelitten.
Aber die Krise ist auch eine Chance, endlich das solidarische Europa zu bauen, das wir so dringend brauchen. Es ist nun auch an Ihnen, Frau Bundeskanzlerin, und an der gesamten deutschen Bundesregierung, diese Chance zum Aufbruch zu nutzen und Europa neu zu einen.
Ich will Ihnen ausdrücklich zu dem deutsch-französischen Vorschlag zum Aufbaufonds gratulieren. Denn er setzt auf Mut anstelle von Zögern und auf Solidarität anstelle von nationalem Egoismus. Ich glaube, er ist ein Zeichen, das sich einige von uns sicherlich auch früher schon gewünscht hätten. Aber voilà, here we are. 
Aber noch ist nichts gewonnen. Es braucht noch jede Menge Arbeit, bis tatsächlich so ein Fonds, ein Programm steht. Es braucht dafür starke Partnerinnen und Partner. Wir Grüne im Europäischen Parlament sind bereit, einen ambitionierten Aufbauplan mit zu unterstützen. Wir stehen ein für einen Fonds, der Zukunftsinvestition ermöglicht und so den Weg ebnet für einen ökologischen und sozialen Umbau der Wirtschaft, der die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit angeht, einen Fonds, der den am meisten betroffenen Ländern in der Europäischen Union hilft, ohne den Schuldenstand mancher Länder noch weiter in die Höhe zu treiben, und einen Fonds, der Rechtsstaatlichkeit verteidigt und das Klima schützt, der aber nicht die alten Fehler wiederholt und auf wirtschaftlich schädliche Bedingungen à la Troika setzt. Dafür setzen wir Grüne uns überall ein: hier in Brüssel, aber auch in den nationalen Parlamenten. 
Die furchtbare Corona-Krise zeigt, dass wir entschlossen handeln können und damit viel erreichen. Diesen Mut und diese Entschlossenheit brauchen wir auch, um uns der Klimakrise entgegenzustellen. Denn der Klimawandel wartet nun mal nicht, bis wir wieder Zeit haben, uns mit ihm zu beschäftigen. Wir sind die erste Generation, die den Klimawandel am eigenen Leib spüren kann: sei es bei Hitzewellen, Waldsterben oder den stärkeren Stürmen, die unsere Gesundheit gefährden und die die Lebensgrundlagen der Menschheit bedrohen. 
Und wir sind zugleich die letzte Generation, die den Klimawandel noch halbwegs aufhalten kann. Wir haben die Antworten für erneuerbare Energien, für die grüne Zukunft, die saubere Umwelt oder den nachhaltigen Verkehr. Wir müssen es nur machen, wir müssen es nur umsetzen. 
Die deutsche Ratspräsidentschaft kann einen wichtigen Beitrag dazu leisten. Zentral sind dabei das Klimagesetz und die EU-Klimaziele bis 2030. Aber die müssen ambitioniert sein, denn wir müssen als großer historischer Treibhausgasemittor dafür sorgen, dass auch andere Länder mit an Bord sind, und unserer historischen Verantwortung gerecht werden. 
Deswegen fordern wir die gesamte Europäische Union auf, eine Treibhausgasreduktion von 65 % bis 2030 zu beschließen. Ich appelliere an Sie: Zeigen Sie Mut zu Europa und zeigen Sie Mut im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel! Die Welt wartet auf ein Signal aus Europa. Die Corona-Krise überwinden und die Klimakrise verhindern: Es kann gelingen. Aber dafür müssen wir jetzt handeln, und dafür braucht es auch Sie, Frau Bundeskanzlerin.

Ska KELLER,2020-06-17,EN,Preparation of the European Council meeting of 19 June 2020 - Recommendations on the negotiations for a new partnership with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-06-17-INT-1-108-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, let’s be honest. No one really expects anything to happen at this European Council with regard to the recovery plan. We all think there will be some haggling and insisting on own positions, and afterwards everyone will go to the national press and say how well they have defended the national interest. Even the President of the European Council gave up on any outcome even before the summit had started. It’s quite shameful really that, when our Heads of State and Government come together, no one expects anything much to happen.
Wouldn’t it be great though if, for once, the expectations of Europeans were over—fulfilled, if just once we didn’t wait until things were too late and until the mood was already really bad. We have an unforeseen crisis in the EU, and we all know that we need to act urgently in order to mitigate the economic impact. The EU as a whole needs to have, and provide, funds for this. The funds need to be targeted into the economy that we want to have tomorrow, not the one that puts profit over planet and people. A major effort is needed, but the benefits are great, especially if we link the investments to the challenges that we anyway have to face, namely the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, social inequality and digitalisation.
Imagine if, for once, governments could ditch the drama and go for bold and for courageous. It would be worthwhile because, in the end, it is in the national interest of every single Member State to have a strong European Union for their citizens and for their economy. Our union is not a zero-sum game. It is the boat in which we are all sitting together. We fail together or we win together. So let’s make sure that we make a win for the future of the European Union.

Ska KELLER,2020-05-27,EN,EU Recovery package (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-05-27-INT-1-023-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, we have indeed a very deep crisis in Europe, and we need to react to that. It’s a big moment of responsibility, of thinking together, that were joining hands and we’re thinking of how to get together out of this crisis.
This Parliament, with a broad majority, has shown a way forward with a substantial recovery fund, a strong MFF – a strong budget – and a Green Deal that helps the economy while addressing the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis which have gone nowhere. I’m very glad to say that Greens all over Europe are actually supporting that, so I’m afraid Mr Weber, dear Manfred, that it is a bit cheap to hide behind the Greens when we actually have a strong support, also public support from the Austrian Greens who are supporting our position and the position of this Parliament.
Maybe it is rather your best friend in Vienna who is causing the problem. But I’m glad to see that you’re also ready and willing to convince them, and try to convince them, and I am glad we can join forces there and try indeed our common job to convince governments all over parties, all over. Because that is what we need to do now, because I do believe that the Commission proposal is a very big step forward and we welcome the focus that you’ve put on grants to make sure that no Member State is left behind in this crisis.
The overall volume might not prove sufficient in time, but in any case, what we need to make sure is that we don’t lessen the ambitions on the MFF because we also need to think further ahead.
You have mentioned – colleagues have mentioned – conditions attached to the fund, and I would urge us all to not repeat the big mistakes of the past and force countries into austerity and blind market ideologies that have never worked, and will not work. Instead, we need to make sure that the money is well invested into projects that will help in the long term, that create jobs and that save the one planet that we have.
To be meaningful in the long term, both the Recovery Fund and the MFF need to incentivise the social and ecological transformation of our economy and promote gender equality – a big problem we’ve seen in this crisis. They also need to follow our minimum common rules such as the rule of law and democracy.
Some governments think that they can do it all alone, but I think they should think again. They have all benefited as much as and even more than other Member States from the single market, from freedom of movement and some, unfortunately, also from a bit too lax tax rules.
Europe needs a strong step ahead. It needs courageous action like that of Schuman 70 years ago, and this Parliament has shown it is ready to do its part. I hope the Member States will follow.
(Applause)
"
Ska KELLER,2020-05-14,EN,70th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-05-14-INT-2-067-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the success of the Schuman Declaration is certainly undoubtable. Lasting peace on a warring continent is a paramount achievement. But still, our Union has come even further, has been even more successful by working together. We expanded to overcome big parts of the Iron Curtain division and integrated in an ever closer Union to the benefit of the people living within. Crises, like the one we are crossing today, prove how much we have come to take for granted all the achievements of our Union. Just think about the freedom of movement. 
However, it is hardly the time to pat ourselves on the back. The world today is very different from that of Schuman. We have digitalisation, globalisation, a growing nationalism, climate change. All those have fundamentally affected our realities, and the COVID-19 crisis today leaves millions without jobs, a stable income or future perspectives. 
Today, our Union needs an immense leap forward. Europe needs again a Schuman-type future-proof solution oriented action. So what can this leap forward be? First of all, it should be a people and planet centred recovery from the multiple crises that Europe is currently facing – the social inequalities, the climate and biodiversity crises, the public health crisis. It is high time we used all the instruments at our disposal to create the most ambitious social, economic and environmental transformation the world has ever seen, and this must ensure that no one is left behind. 
Secondly, this leap forward must re-anchor our European Union in the respect of citizens’ rights, democracy and fundamental rights, because these have too often been sidelined in recent years. 
Thirdly, a strong and future-proofed Union must also look beyond its immediate borders. Our Union must always offer shelter to those seeking protection. It must be open to countries that want to join and meet our rules. 
We are living through challenging times for our Union. We must now prove that we can live up to those challenges. Seventy years from now, history will judge whether we have passed the test.

Ska KELLER,2020-03-26,EN,European coordinated response to the COVID-19 outbreak (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-03-26-INT-1-040-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, in these dire times, my sympathy and that of all my Group – and I’m sure all this House – goes to the victims of COVID-19 and to their families. Our thanks and gratitude go to all the workers on the front lines for tackling this crisis and for ensuring the basic functioning of our society, even in times of a lockdown.
Thanks and gratitude are, however, not enough. This crisis makes clear how much we all depend on the tremendous work of often underpaid and overworked people, be it in hospitals, shops or care facilities. We must reflect our gratitude by ensuring the improvement of their pay and of their working conditions. In times of crisis, we need solidarity among neighbours, among citizens and also among EU Member States and it took a long time before solidarity started to appear. First, there were acts that were the opposite – export bans for medical equipment, and border closures that left people desperately trying to get home, stranded at borders for hours and days in very unsafe sanitary conditions. Luckily, this has finally changed. Now countries are starting to learn from each other – sending medical supplies and treating patients from different countries. This is what European solidarity looks like, and we urge all Member States with available capacities to support such actions and relieve those hardest hit.
What is more, European solidarity must not stop at EU borders. In particular, support, including financial, technical and medical, should be extended to the countries that are working to join the EU in the future. In these dark times, the EU must stand in solidarity with the Western Balkans. 
While many of the measures necessary right now fall under national competence, there’s quite a lot of things that the EU can and should do at this moment, including coordinating the response actions of Member States, as well as pooling best practices in supporting those groups most impacted by the corona crisis. The single market must reinforce the efforts to tackle the crisis. Intense cooperation must exist between the EU institutions and Member States to ensure that medical supplies, food and other essential goods can move freely across borders to meet needs across the EU. 
The economic consequences will be very serious. The EU and the Member States have to think outside of their self-imposed limits and be courageous and be creative in finding and delivering the medical, social and economic means to overcome COVID-19. This includes using every financial instrument at our disposal to support the millions of people who lost their job or lost their income because of this crisis. To help the hardest-hit countries, we need common bonds like the corona bonds, so that Italy, but also other countries, can get back on their feet and further economic turmoil in the eurozone can be prevented. 
Extraordinary times need extraordinary measures and, to fight the spread of the virus, restrictions have been put into place. However, restrictions on fundamental rights to fight this outbreak must be as limited as possible. They must be effective, necessary and proportionate. We must not allow this crisis to be used as a pretext for undermining democratic checks and balances. Governments need to remain accountable to democratically elected parliaments and to the people that they serve, especially in times of crisis. Solidarity means that we have a responsibility not to forget the most vulnerable groups in our societies, such as women and children who are not safe at home, homeless people, people living in extreme poverty, but also refugees, who often live in overcrowded facilities. It is especially worrying to see the situation in many Greek islands, where refugees live in unbearable conditions without any or much access to sanitary facilities or to medical support. Those islands need to be evacuated immediately before a big humanitarian catastrophe happens as a result of COVID-19 spreading to camps, where sanitation and isolation is impossible. Many towns and many communities all over Europe are very ready to accommodate refugees. Member States should finally allow them to help. 
Together, with solidarity, we will overcome this crisis one day, but when the immediate threat is lowered, there will still be things to do. We will have to help the economy to recover from the severe shock with an investment plan that is also geared towards a social and ecological transition. We will have to draw the lessons from the crisis. 
While today is not the day for us to see all the consequences and all the lessons that we should draw from this, there are some lessons that are very obvious already, for example, that people who do work that is of absolute importance to all of us – like health workers, cleaners, supermarket workers, etc. – need to be valued according to their importance, not just by applauding them, but also by paying them fairly, i.e. much, much better. Our health system should not be subject to austerity and should not have to aim to gain profits. Hospitals, doctors and nurses are what we ultimately all depend on, and they need to be able to perform their tasks and have capacities and reserves. As I myself come from a medical family, both the daily struggles of the health system as well as the risks doctors and nurses are taking in these extraordinary times, strike close to home. The deep appreciation of medical care these days needs to continue post-crisis and to enable a better resourced medical system. 
This crisis is testing us all – as citizens, as Member States, as Europe – and while we have to physically stand apart, we can see a growing common spirit among people in Europe. All of Europe is mourning the victims of the virus. All of Europe is applauding the front—line workers. This crisis has brought Europeans together in their hearts. Now let’s also make sure we are uniting Europe in our answers to this crisis, and we will prevail.

Ska KELLER,2020-03-10,EN,Statement by the President,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-03-10-INT-2-013-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, unfortunately, on this Women’s Day as on every other women’s day, and as indeed on every day of all of our lives as women, we realise that equality is far, far away from being realised. Women’s Day is not so much a day of celebration; it is a day to remind us of the struggle that has been done in the past, and on the struggle that still lies ahead of us. So much still needs to be done.
Since we’re in a Parliament, I indeed want to remind us of the big lack of women in decision-making. Just because we might see one woman somewhere in a leading position, that just reminds us of the stark contrast of everyone else in the room usually being a man. That needs to change, but we can also all do something about that. All of our parties, all of our list elections, everyone can do something about it. It is not a natural phenomenon that women are under-represented. Everyone can, but also everyone has to contribute to this struggle.
While it takes forever, as we have seen, to break old problems, to break all old inequalities, new ones are rising by the day. For example, if we look at the online hate that people – women – are facing; the hate that we have received is an old problem but to see it so much multiplied in the online space is a new phenomenon. Also the bias of algorithms now coming up and soon having a very big influence – already having a very big, bad influence on our lives – is something that is a new phenomenon. So let’s never ever for one day even think the fight is over. It is not over. It needs to be continued with women of all the regions, of all religions, no matter how they look, no matter whom they love, and let’s not forget, either, the struggle of trans women, who are often overlooked.

And while we’re following very closely what’s happening with the Covid-19 spread and impact, I think what we also should be looking at is the wider impact and the wider effect it has on health systems. There are also other health problems around that might get worse when hospitals are very busy dealing with the coronavirus infections and health systems are often already at their limit. 
And I think that should also encourage us to learn some lessons – I mean, there will be many more lessons to be learned in the future, but already at this point I think we can take and draw some lessons. One of them is to really strengthen the health systems, and not rely on there always being good and sunny days. We also need to have our health systems in shape for emergency situations. 
I think another important thing is that we need to have social systems that enable people to indeed take sick leave, to stay at home when they’re not feeling well, or even to stay in quarantine, and that’s not possible if you’re only paid by the hour. That’s not possible when you’re paid badly, if you don’t get sick leave support, for example. 
Another lesson, as has also been mentioned by colleagues, is that maybe it’s not so smart to leave the production of vital goods to one country, one region alone – that we should spread production more widely and more economically in that sense and not just be reliant on very specific areas or very specific economies. 
And while we need to listen to the medical experts and take note of the measures and emergency measures that Parliament should take – that everyone should take – it is also up to politics to draw those conclusions, to draw lessons and deal with them.
And, most importantly, I think I want to reiterate what the Commissioner said. We need to work together. A crisis can only be overcome if we all show solidarity. Exclusion and discrimination does not help anyone. It’s the wrong way forward. We need to stand together in solidarity, especially when the going gets tough.

We have one catastrophe of a humanitarian dimension at the Greek-Turkish border, but we also have one on the Greek islands, and we have one – let’s not forget about that – in northern Syria around Idlib. It’s the fate of those women, of men and children – that is the crisis, and that is what we need to care about.
It is shocking that Europe will only care about refugees when they pose a problem at our own borders. It is shocking how Europe answers people in need with tear gas, with breaking the law and with suspending human rights. Is that what we really want to be?
Those who are fleeing from a war, those who need protection, and those who are living in unbearable conditions on Greek islands or anywhere else, they need our solidarity. The EU needs to support the Member States on the borders, but it completely fails if this support is understood as just more policing and keeping people out. Rather, the EU should support Greece with applying international law by a rapid redistribution of the people trapped on the islands or at the border. The EU should focus on safely distributing the refugees. Hundreds of municipalities all across Europe have volunteered to accommodate refugees. They are real heroes, and those communities deserve our praise and they deserve our support. Europe cannot just turn a blind eye if it wants to be worth anything. It needs to help because we are all human beings and we are all equal.

Also, the Commission, which was just recently elected, has been saying that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a key part of their agenda. This is the first free trade agreement (FTA) that will come with the Commission’s mandate. However, the FTA was negotiated without such a commitment before Parliament asked, in January, for this binding trade and sustainable development chapter.
Also in January, this House voted on a report calling for streamlining human rights into all its policies. However, unfortunately, they’re not being streamlined into the FTA with Vietnam, because we have seen a lot of human rights violations – also just recently with the crackdown of a peaceful protest in January – and we’ve been asking for a firm and sanctionable commitment from the Vietnamese Government to improving the human rights situation. Nothing of this sort has been done, and that’s why we think this needs further commitment, from both the Commission and the Vietnamese Government. Therefore, we ask to postpone the vote on the four reports in total.

It’s a dramatic event that a Member State would leave, and it’s an immensely sad one as well. But I refuse to accept this historic mistake as the end. It will neither it put an end to the friendship between the people of Great Britain and on the European continent, nor will we give up hope that the UK will return home at some point – here where it belongs, to the European family. But while this week is a very sad moment, it’s not a moment at all that brings us closer to any end of the EU, for example, as some who brought about Brexit might have wanted it to: quite the opposite. If we didn’t have the EU already, it would now be the perfect moment to invent it, and the Europeans have come together because there are problems that you can only solve together and because together they are stronger in whatever challenge appears in the world. And there are plenty of challenges today, and we need to address them together.
And that’s why it’s so important this week also to discuss the work programme. This work programme will be the chance to prove what we are worth. Commissioner, you mentioned in your speech the climate crisis, which is indeed a huge challenge that every state and every continent is affected by, and it’s high time for urgent action. We’re very happy that this Commission puts an emphasis on initiatives tackling the climate crisis as well as the dramatic loss of biodiversity on our planet. It is, of course, way too early to say if they’re going to be sufficient; that will depend on the details of your proposals. But also it will depend on whether a majority of this House will support ambitious climate legislation, not to mention the Member States as well, which we need to have on board. Therefore, it will depend on all of us how much climate action the EU will undertake and how much the EU will contribute to the global efforts to save the planet after having contributed – actually, a lot – to its destruction in the past.
The Commission is also the guardian of the Treaties, and you mentioned some action in that regard to make sure that Member States don’t deviate from the rule of law, and it is time to put our common commitment into action. This year will show which way the Commission is heading, and we need courageous steps forward into a new European Union.

The European Commission has already made some promises in that regard, which we applaud, but it also needs the Member States and too many of them have been blocking environmental progress in the past. This needs to change. We need the Member States along, active and pushing when it comes to climate action. It will be your task to ensure this, and that is a big responsibility as well. To fill this role, we also encourage you and your government to implement your own fair and ecological transition in Croatia. 
Another area where we would like to see more action from the Member States is rule of law and human rights, and I’m very glad that you mentioned that. It needs some more peer pressure from governments to bring Member States back on track. Rule of law, fundamental rights and freedoms are pillars of the European Union and should not be weakened and that goes for all Member States. Here, Prime Minister, I’m concerned about the reports about the Croatian police disregarding international law and procedures in their treatment of refugees and migrants. There are even reports of systematic violence and abuse, such as destruction of property, humiliation, beatings and even the use of firearms. These abuses have been repeatedly pointed out by NGOs and have been widely reported in the media, but the Croatian government has so far neither stopped nor investigated those reports. Prime Minister, that is not acceptable in any EU country, but in any country anywhere, refugee rights are human rights, and I urge you to ensure that those rights are being respected. The Croatian borders are European borders and what happens there is a responsibility for all of us, so we will not turn a blind eye. 
Croatia is a beautiful country and the youngest member of our family. This Presidency is a big chance for your country and your government to show the rest of Europe what your visions and your ideas for our common future are, but the Presidency will also turn a spotlight on Croatia and how much your global words are met with local action, both on human rights as well as on climate justice. You can count on our support for bringing forward climate justice, social equality and rule of law, but you can also count on us to call out any human rights violation, no matter where, no matter by what government.

Ska KELLER,2019-12-18,EN,Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 12 and 13 December 2019 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-18-INT-3-045-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, while the heads of state and government were meeting in Brussels last week, the COP 25 in Madrid was stalling. So maybe, next year, it would be a good idea if the heads of state went to Glasgow – to the COP26 – to show the importance that they give to the topic of climate protection (if indeed they do).
In light of the disappointing outcome of Madrid, it’s good to see that there was an agreement on climate neutrality in 2050 at the summit. This is a very important step, but of course it can only be one step forward: 2050 is quite late, and setting targets is only half the battle. What really matters is less the targets set for later on – they are important sure – but rather the actions you take today in order to achieve those targets. And for those concrete actions, the discussion on the long-term budget – the MFF – is the perfect opportunity, because the EU budget needs to support the climate targets and not undermine them. Right now, the proposals that we have on the table are not doing that job; they don’t match the climate talk. There are still too many harmful subsidies that are being dished out; too little going into the protection of climate and biodiversity. 
So I hope Member States will start to walk the walk when it comes to climate and budget. It was disappointing to see that the Polish Government would isolate itself by not agreeing to the target. Let’s not forget that 70% of the Poles themselves are supporting that target, so I really hope the Polish Government will change its my mind: the later you start the transition the harder it will get, and the climate crisis does not stop at any one country’s border. 
Brexit is – and remains – a tragedy, but this is not the end. We will never give up on our British friends. We will never forget them, and who knows: one day we might be able to say ‘welcome back, UK; welcome home’.

Ska KELLER,2019-11-27,EN,Presentation by the Commission President-elect of the College of Commissioners and their programme (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-27-INT-3-017-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear Commissioner candidates, you are running today for leading the European Union: a Union that started out as a project of peace, of democracy, of human rights – a fantastic project. Whereas, right now, if we look around us, thousands of people are drowning at our borders. More than five women get killed by their partners every day. And a Union where some of the Member States are turning away from these basic values of democracy, of rule of law and of freedom that so many of the European citizens have fought so hard for. A Union that risks to fail in the face of the climate crisis, thereby risking the livelihood of the younger generation and future generations.
But it’s also a Union with a great potential to be the front-runner for climate protection, to be the place of innovation and for visionaries; the continent that would stand up for its values and for human rights, be it at home or in the world. So today, the question is: will the new Commission, will you be ready to fulfil those potentials? Will you be able to meet the challenges of the environmental, social and democratic crisis that we do have in Europe right now? This will take courage. It will take conviction. During the hearings we’ve heard conviction in some of you, but not in all of you, and not on all topics. How, for example, is the Commission going to deliver an ambitious climate-protection programme if there is no will to change the agricultural and the trade policy? I can tell you that this is not going to work. Green headlines are just not enough. We need ambitious content. We need an ambitious agenda, and without a deep reform of the agricultural policy and of the trade agenda, any climate policy must remain half-hearted. And we just don’t have the time for that.
(Applause)
Let me point out some other problems as well. It is an unprecedented situation that the boss of one of the biggest IT companies in Europe will be a Commissioner for the internal market, including the digital economy, and thus overseeing the area his former company is one of the biggest players in. We acknowledge and we appreciate even the steps that Mr Breton has committed himself to undertaking in order to minimise the conflict of interest, but we do think that the conflict of interest here is inherent in his portfolio, and he didn’t have a voice over that. But we do think that this is a big, big problem and that the digital market should have been removed from his portfolio. And as Greens, we cannot accept this sort of conflict of interest, which risks our reputation as EU institutions.
Another big problem lies, unfortunately, with our Commissioner from Hungary, sent to us with best regards from Mr Orbán. How can somebody who represents a government that is constantly undermining and breaking EU law and values, how can someone like that be telling countries that want to join the European Union that they absolutely have to follow rule of law and European law? That is cynical.
(Applause)
I believe that hardly anything embodies the European spirit as much as our integration policy. The idea that countries are willing and eager to join the European Union, to join our common union built on peace, democracy and freedom: that is the flame burning for us in Europe. And what are we telling those countries that are right now willing to change their policies, even their name? We’re telling them that they’re not important, that their voice doesn’t matter, that their aspirations don’t matter. I think we have made enough mistakes in that area recently. Let’s not add another.
(Applause)
President von der Leyen, we have raised those issues continuously. This is nothing new to you, but it’s really for those reasons that we cannot support your Commission. But we are willing to work with the Commission in order to strengthen European democracy and human rights; in order to tackle the climate crisis and to foster European integration. Whenever you and your college take initiatives in that regard, we are more than eager to cooperate with you, to work together with you. You will find in us a constructive partner, but rest assured that we will also be critical if you don’t. You can count on that.
Colleagues, it is time for us to act: climate cannot wait, social inequality cannot wait to be resolved. And we hope that this Commission will surprise us in many positive ways, and we’re willing to give you a head start in that as well. Thank you very much. Good luck.

Ska KELLER,2019-11-27,EN,Election of the Commission (vote),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-27-INT-3-108-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the new Commission takes office at a time when the climate emergency doesn’t leave us much time to act. We’re happy to see that climate and environmental issues are a key priority for the new Commission and, by the way, also a key priority for more than 90% of the European population.
However, we’re not so sure that the headlines will be followed by concrete action because if the Commission, as it has announced, does not change its agricultural and trade policy, then any climate measure will remain half—hearted. We are also happy to see that more women than ever are part of the Commission, even though it’s curious to see that some governments couldn’t find any women in their country. So, more work needs to be done to ensure a gender balance and also an overall better representation of European society in the Commission. 
We have found in the hearings some very good candidates, but also some that made us have doubts – doubts on conflict of interest and how serious you are on European values, on the rule of law and on women’s rights. Madam President—elect, we will not support a Commission that is not clear on those issues. But be sure that, whenever you take an initiative that protects the climate, that strengthens a social Europe and that enhances the rule of law, we are more than ready to support you. But we will also point out when we think that the Commission is taking a wrong turn or is being too timid. Europe needs decisive action now and we hope that you will feel the courage and the strength to push for change, to stand up against the Council when needed, and to base your work on European values, such as human rights for all and on the rule of law. We want you to act because it’s high time and that’s why we don’t give you a red card, even though we have pointed out all of those problems I’ve mentioned today at various times and we haven’t seen them addressed. 
But we also don’t want to give you a blank cheque either and that’s why our group has decided to abstain today as a head start in terms of trust that we hope will be justified. We’re looking forward to a good cooperation with you and we wish you and your College all the strength, all the courage and energy that it takes not just to hold our continent together, but to bring it forward. 
(Applause)

Ska KELLER,2019-11-26,EN,Preparation of the European Council meeting of 12 and 13 December 2019 (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-26-INT-2-019-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the Heads of State and Government are going to meet in Brussels right after the Madrid climate summit. I hope they take some of the Madrid spirit along with them, because I’m sure they will have heard a lot of urgency from other governments of small island states, of coastal states and of countries and continents that are not as wealthy and prosperous as the European Union overall. So, I hope they take along that urgency and then put it and convert it into some real action, because after Madrid the real action has to start.
As it stands right now, not a single one of the European Union Member States has submitted a national greenhouse gas reduction plan that would be adequate or in any way sufficient in order to reach the Paris Agreement targets. But the EU targets are also far from sufficient. In fact, they were agreed in 2014, so before the Paris summit. Clearly, we need to step up the game because, right now, Europe does not lead the game. We are looking elsewhere; we are telling other countries that they should do something. But that doesn’t work. We need to act ourselves; we cannot wait for others to act.
A stable climate is not just a nice thing to have, it’s absolutely vital in order to have a liveable planet for the younger generation and also for future generations. It’s vital for security and for peace worldwide. And also, if we’re lagging behind, as we’re doing right now, we’re also losing out on technologies, on climate jobs that, right now, our competitors elsewhere in the world are developing.
It is time to act and the Member States need to finally agree on the climate neutrality target of 2050. But, let’s be clear, and let’s keep in mind that that is not a very ambitious target. We should actually do much more to follow the Finnish example and be more ambitious, because 2050 is really late. But having targets for some time in the future is anyway not enough; we need to have concrete measures right now. We need to make sure right now that we will, at some point, achieve and reach targets.
And what better way to use as a concrete measure our long—term budget? This is where we decide where we put our money, and we should put our money where our mouth is. That means that we should have a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) that invests in renewable energies and in ecological agriculture and not, as it is foreseen at present, in agricultural mass production and in fossil fuels. We need to change our priorities. If we don’t change where the money goes, then nothing will change in terms of the actual policies.
The EU has to play its fair part in a fair transition and that also needs resources for the European Union. Otherwise we have a lot of demands but not the resources to implement them. And that’s why we, the Greens, fully subscribe to the Parliament’s position of having at least 1.3% of the GNI as the overall amount.
But on the income side we also need to be sustainable. A plastics tax or a carbon border adjustment tax is not just a revenue; it can really be a means of how to shape policies and make sure that we have policies that protect the environment and support a fair transition. And of all of these elements, the European Council can, but also really should, deliver. Because in order to stay credible, the EU has to lead with ambitious targets and we have to deliver them at home. If not now, when? So, I wish the best of luck to the Finnish Presidency and really hope that all the groups here can contribute by urging governments to actually play their role and say yes to climate neutrality, yes to an ambitious MFF and not just continue with business as usual.

I would really like to ask colleagues for their support.

Ska KELLER,2019-11-13,EN,30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-13-INT-1-014-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, thirty years ago, the Wall did not just fall, it was brought down by very courageous people, people who took a very high and very concrete personal risk. They fought for fair and free elections, for the freedom of expression, for an end to being caged-in and under constant observation – all those things that we take for granted right now. But back then, those demands could get you into prison, they could get you tortured, lose your job and lose your social connections. But despite all of those risks, people took to the streets, organised already long before 1989, and never gave up. It is this courage that changed the world and it is this courage that’s still changing the world today.
Also today, we need to be vigilant, not to forget the lessons from 1989. Democracy needs to be gained every day again and again, in every action that we do here in this House but also everywhere in Europe. Unfortunately, there are governments right now who are trying to dismantle democracy, bit by bit. This is a disgrace, especially given the sacrifices that the citizens in countries like Hungary made to free their country. Those who shut down universities, those who arrest civil society and build walls against refugees, they are betraying the demonstrators from 1989.
(Applause)
Freedom is something that needs to be expanded every day as well and too many people are still not free in this world, not free for who they are, whom they love or where they’re from. We are all citizens of this world, born free and born equal. Discrimination and hatred should not prevail.
Freedom of expression is also being curbed when hatred and threats are being issued and used against people active in politics, active in their communities. When people there are faced with threats on an everyday level, then this is a problem for freedom of expression, as well as democracy. Constant observation is also becoming a trend again, but we should never forget what history teaches us – surveillance, a control state, does not lead to freedom or security. It ends both. We don’t know what the future will bring, and any law we do here always needs to work also when governments don’t mean well.
Things have changed a lot over the past years, over the past 30 years especially. If you look at the border zone now that once divided Germany, where hundreds of people lost their lives trying to cross looking for freedom, often also being assisted by other people who helped them, this area is now a major production area, safeguarding climate and biodiversity for the future generations and becoming a symbol of hope. The borders that divided Europe have now become places where people meet, get to know each other. But let’s not forget, there are many walls still up today that need to be torn down. There are many people today, as back then, who are looking for freedom. Let us not turn our back on them. Let us not forget what it means to look for freedom, to not have it and then to gain it.
Without the courageous people thirty years ago, I wouldn’t be here and many colleagues would not be either. Europe as we know it, only exists because the wall that divided us all finally was torn down. But 9 November 1989 is not a date where we should hold commemoratory speeches and just congratulate each other on how well it all worked back then. I believe it is an anniversary to remind us to be courageous, to tear down the walls that divide us and to be the change that we want to see in the world.

Ska KELLER,2019-07-17,EN,Presentation of the programme of activities of the Finnish Presidency of the Council (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-07-17-INT-3-017-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister to the European Parliament and to the European scene. Good luck with the Presidency. We’re also happy to hear your priorities, especially the one on the climate because it is very urgent. This is the one and only planet that we have, that we all live on and where we need to make sure that it is also possible to live on it in the future. 
While we absolutely share the ambition on the goals – and I think the rest of Europe could learn a lot from Finland in setting very ambitious targets – we all know, of course, that setting ambitious targets is only half – if that – of the job. The real job is in putting very concrete measures into place right now because in order to end up with good and ambitious targets you need to add ‘now’. It’s not enough to just put some numbers for later on into the paper. That’s why I would like to also ask you to push ahead on the reform of the agricultural policy. What we have right now on the table is far from enough to secure biodiversity and climate protection. We need a fresh start here, including with the multiannual financial framework (MFF), where a lot of money is still being put into climate—harmful subsidies. We need a reversion here, we need to make sure that the money that we spend in the European Union is put into places which will help the ecological and social transition, and there we need much more action.
You’ve also mentioned the rule of law and we very much agree with that priority because it’s really urgent. Therefore, I would also urge you to take up the issue of the parliamentary report on Hungary, to discuss it in the Council and to also make sure that Parliament, our rapporteurs, are being invited and are being heard by the Council, by the Member States, and that it doesn’t fall under the carpet.
Refugees are another big issue. Rescue at sea is right now not happening in the Mediterranean and we cannot allow that people are drowning in the Mediterranean and no one is there to help. I think you can lead by example, making sure that even if there is not an agreement of all Member States – which is a pity, it’s a disgrace – still some Member States can go ahead in order to stop this disgraceful and inhumane situation we have right now at our borders.
Lastly, I also want to congratulate Finland for setting a precedent on the issue of transparency as Council. I think in the past we had less interesting precedents being set there, with lobbyism, with sponsorship and I don’t know what. So it’s very good that you are taking a first step and are putting more transparency into lobby meetings. We hope that all the other Member States and the future presidencies can learn from that and that maybe you will also find some space for even more transparency. We would have some ideas if you were interested. Thank you very much and good luck and we’re ready to support you on those issues.

Five weeks ago you as citizens used your right to vote and elected us as your representatives. You have given us the mandate to shape the future of this House, and also the future of the European Union, and I want to thank you for putting your trust in this institution. But you have also given us a very clear message, and the message is that the European project is very much alive. You, the voters, have answered the hateful and divisive rhetoric of the populist right with a clear pro-European message, and I thank you for that. 
(Applause)
Dear colleagues, the past elections have seen an increased voter turnout, and this is a very encouraging sign, but it also means responsibility to us as the European Parliament. Thanks to the voters, we now have a strong mandate to decide on the future of Europe and to hold the Commission and the Member States accountable. And as parliamentarians we have received a mandate to strengthen the European Parliament as an institution.
And I say: let’s strengthen the Parliament today and let’s strengthen it together by electing a Parliament President that embodies the independence of our institution. We cannot accept that the Presidency of this House is being treated as a bargaining chip in old-school backroom Council negotiations. This is not the signal we need to send to the citizens. 
There can be no doubt the European Union is more important than ever. In the wake of climate crisis, growing social inequalities and international confrontation, we need Europe more than ever. But as EU institutions we haven’t always been very successful in reaching out to the citizens and telling them, convincing them, that we are actually working for them, addressing the issues that are most important to them. And as President I want to renew the trust and I want to make sure that the European Parliament is the space where citizens are discussing.
In the past few years we have been having debates on the future of Europe with heads of state and government, with presidents and so on, and this has been very interesting. But why not now change the direction and say “we’ll open the House and discuss the future of the European Union with the citizens, with civil society, with the people that shape our continent today”? 
In Parliament we clearly defend human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and as Parliament President I want to be the ambassador for exactly those values and principles. And in order also to be credible as an institution we need to work, always and every day, to make sure we are fulfilling the principles that we ask others to fulfil, be it transparency, be it gender equality, be it inclusion, workers’ rights, and also reducing our ecological footprint. And, dear colleagues, the European Union is the biggest historic achievement of our continent. It has ensured peace, friendship and prosperity on a continent that used to be dominated by war and by hatred.
As elected Members of the European Parliament we have a shared responsibility to honour and to defend this historic achievement that we have inherited. I was born in a country that was divided by the Iron Curtain. I have lived on the border between Poland and Germany. I have seen for myself what it means when Europe brings people together, when Europe overcomes borders in the mines and on the ground. And I see also for myself a personal responsibility to defend that European heritage. 
In order to defend Europe we also need to show the courage to change it for the better and, as the only directly elected EU institution, the European Parliament has a key role in making this leap forward. This House has been for many years fighting to defend and increase our rights as Parliament, because that means increasing the rights and representation of the citizens, the citizens who elect us, who send us to this Chamber. And to continue this work on parliamentary rights, I am running today for the honour of chairing this Parliament and I would be grateful for your support.
(Applause)

Ska KELLER,2019-07-03,EN,Election of the President of Parliament (second ballot) (announcement of results),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-07-03-INT-2-036-0000_EN.html,"  Ska Keller,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, congratulations on your election. We are looking forward to working with you. I think ‘rights of the Parliament’ are exactly the right words, this is exactly what we need to discuss, because so far as Parliament we have always been working on increasing, advancing, the rights of Parliament because that also means increasing the rights of the citizens.
Right now our position on that is being challenged, as we all know, so we have to make sure that were not giving up on that, that we’re working on further improving and increasing European democracy. That is our task and we cannot give up on that. We also need to continue to work to support the idea that someone for Commission president should have been, and should be, a lead candidate. 
We need to work on transnationalists, but we also need to do our work inside the European Parliament because it needs to have us to push for all these democratic rights, and there we also need to do some work when it comes to transparency inside the European Parliament. 
So I’ve mentioned that, but I would also like to ask you something else, Mr President. You remember the resolutions that we had in the last legislature about how to prevent and what to do about sexual harassment, which is also a problem inside the European Parliament, unfortunately. I ask you and urge you to take those resolutions seriously, because people might be patient but people who are victims certainly should not be. 
And then there’s one more issue. We are here today as the Greens/EFA Group and we are missing one of our Members who is not able to come here because his Member State has not put forward his name, even though he has been elected as a Member of the European Parliament. Through no fault of his own he cannot be here today, so I would like to ask you to look into the case and help us to restore the parliamentary rights of Mr Oriol Junqueras.
