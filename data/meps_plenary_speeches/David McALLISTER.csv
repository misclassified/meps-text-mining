David McALLISTER,2023-12-12,EN,EU-US relations (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-12-INT-2-497-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Mr President, dear colleagues, transatlantic cooperation has been tried and tested over time, but our bond has proven itself time and again, most recently in the response to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. Here we have shown remarkable unity, not least by coordinating our military support within the Ukraine Defence Contact Group.
The United States of America is and will be our most important partner and ally as the European Union. People are at the bedrock of this relationship. Bilateral trade and investment supports millions of jobs in Europe and the United States, respectively, and we are each other’s strongest geo-economic base. But indeed, we need to and can do more in order to maximise the added value of transatlantic relations by exploiting the opportunities for cooperation presented by the EU-US security and defence dialogue.
I am convinced that on both sides of the Atlantic there is genuine interest to cement the foundations of a relationship so that we can meet the challenges of the years and decades to come. Let me thank the rapporteur and the shadows for presenting this very good report.

David McALLISTER,2023-11-21,EN,EU/New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-21-INT-2-175-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, this free trade agreement negotiated over the course of four years and signed on 9 July indeed marks a significant milestone in our bilateral relations. It reinforces New Zealand Aotearoa as a valued trade and investment partner and it strengthens the European Union’s presence in the Indo-Pacific.
All in all, as many colleagues have mentioned, this agreement removes trade barriers for companies on both sides, particularly when it comes to tariffs, public procurement and the protection of intellectual property. This promises legal certainty and, hence, ultimately incentives, investment and trade.
Yet this agreement is not merely a trade and investment deal. It is a testament to shared values and mutual trust between two like-minded partners. Just like us, New Zealand adheres to the Paris Climate Agreement, New Zealand is committed to sustainable development and New Zealand is dedicated to core labour standards. In a world facing increasing protectionism, New Zealand and the European Union have together set a positive example and laid an important foundation for fair, rules-based and sustainable trade.
I am glad that all our Member States have understood just how important New Zealand Aotearoa is in this process, and I trust that we will pave the way for the agreement to come into force in the first half of next year.

Only 6.1 per cent of the world's population lives in a functioning democracy according to the most recent Global Democracy Index. More than a third of the global population lives under authoritarian rule. Precisely because democracy is the beating heart and core of the European Union’s identity, we need to reinforce the right to participate in the world. Autocracies employ increasingly versatile tools to legitimise elections that are neither fair nor free - be it through fake observers or the abuses of information and communication technology. The European Union needs to strengthen the link between election observation work and our wider support for human rights and democracy. Parliament’s Democracy Support and Election Coordination Group is a dedicated structure that coordinates our work in this area. Over the last year and especially since 2014, our democracy support activities have been ramped up. We have developed expertise and capacity to provide comprehensive assistance to non-EU parliaments through a number of activities undertaken ahead of, during and after elections.

And yet, they have succeeded in introducing key legislative initiatives tailored to the nine conditions set by the European Commission. These are tremendous efforts. Soon, the Commission’s upcoming enlargement package will testify to these reforms. It is now up to us in the European Union to live up to our own commitments at a political level. We need to introduce further permanent means of diplomatic engagement, sectoral cooperation and financial assistance. And we need to strengthen the new European Union partnership mission in Moldova. Moldova’s entry into the European Single Market would boost exports, attract investments and foster integration with the European Union. And colleagues, both parties would benefit from starting EU accession negotiations. The citizens of Moldova deserve the perspective of joining our European Union. Mulţumesc.

This will effectively leave all those in exile stranded abroad without valid identification. This is another act of subjugation. This is another piece of evidence that the dictator in Minsk is ready to betray his population to secure his own power. Tougher sanctions need to be the consequence – against Lukashenko and all his henchmen that are responsible for violence, for repression and for the complicity in the atrocities committed in Ukraine. While Lukashenko is pushing Belarus ever deeper into the Russian orbit, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who we will welcome tomorrow noon in this hemicycle, presents a diametrically different vision. Let us elevate our relations with the Belarusian democratic forces to a more formal level. The new Consultative Group is a first step in the right direction. It is our duty – it is our self-interest even – to continue providing the opposition with the resources required to keep the Belarusian democratic dream alive.

David McALLISTER,2023-09-11,EN,European Defence Industry Reinforcement through common Procurement Act (EDIRPA) (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-11-INT-1-051-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, as we have stated so often in this plenary, to this day, 80 % of defence equipment is procured at purely national level. 
Not only do we need to invest more in defence but we definitely need to invest better, and better means, of course, more European. Together we get better prices, profit from faster delivery times and avoid a regrettable lack of interoperability in our national capabilities. 
EDIPRA, as previous speakers have pointed out, serves precisely this purpose. This instrument will pool the demand of Member States and incentivise joint procurement by covering the administrative costs related to such cross-border cooperation. 
Small- and medium-sized enterprises are key enablers of such collaborative efforts. I am glad to see their contribution recognised in this instrument. 
But with a budget of EUR 300 million till December 2024, the envisaged financial volume, indeed, falls short of the actual needs that should not be dismissed. 
Yet the political will for the instrument itself is a historic step towards a European Defence Union, because for the first time the collaborative procurement of defence equipment is supported directly from the budget of the European Union. Well done, I say, to the rapporteurs.

David McALLISTER,2023-06-13,EN,Situation in Lebanon (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-283-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, for months now, the current situation in Lebanon is extremely alarming. Lebanon has the largest per capita number of refugees in the world. The state is nearly collapsing due to the political, economic, social, financial and health crisis and in the end, a state of institutional breakdown. Since the last general elections in May 2022, which I was able to observe on the ground, a fully-fledged government has still not been formed. Lebanon needs to swiftly elect a president and break the institutional gridlock. Operational and functioning public institutions are urgently required to start pursuing long overdue reforms without any further delay, to strengthen accountability, to increase transparency, and to tackle corruption. 
Colleagues, it is regrettable that the municipal elections have been postponed again. Proper democratic and free local elections must be held without any delay. The European Union should provide technical and financial assistance to enable these elections to be held in the best possible conditions. 
And finally, almost three years have passed since the Beirut port explosion. A transparent, independent, neutral and effective investigation into this explosion must be a priority. Commissioner Lenarčič, given the dire situation in Lebanon, the EU must now engage to prevent the state collapse and to help alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people with a strong, critical and demanding focus on delivering reforms.

David McALLISTER,2023-06-13,EN,Situation in Nicaragua (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-322-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Mr President, dear High Representative / Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, look, we have all heard very good arguments from previous speakers. Most of us, apart from a few exceptions, will agree that the authoritarian regime of Mr Ortega and Ms Murillo has systematically undermined Nicaragua’s democratic structures, including the separation of powers, the electoral system and the respect for human rights.
The European Parliament has, rightly so, strongly condemned the repression in Nicaragua, and repeatedly called for the liberation of all political prisoners, for the return to the rule of law and for a dialogue between the regime and the opposition. 
Indeed, the dictatorship of Mr Ortega and Ms Murillo maintained strong ties to the other authoritarian regimes such as Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. It has also been consistently outspoken in its support for the Kremlin, in particular in its voting record at the United Nations. 
High Representative, one point I would like to finally make. We need to make sure that our financial assistance supports the people in need and the country does not end up in the hands of the regime and its associates. European taxpayers hard-earned money must not be misused to legitimise the undemocratic and autocratic regime in Managua.

All of us are very concerned by the social unrest and the political instability that Peru has been going through since December. I deplore at least 67 killed people and more than 1 300 injured in clashes with law enforcement forces since the beginning of the protests. It is essential to end the violence and to investigate any possible violations of human rights. In this highly polarised and unstable context, only a constructive dialogue between the government and all political actors, including the participation of civil society and affected communities, can, in the end, pave the way to a swift political solution that preserves the constitutional order, the rule of law and human rights.
Regaining trust in the democratic institutions is important to ease the current tensions. Therefore, I ask you, dear High Representative, to continue the EU’s full, committed support to the Peruvian efforts in this regard. As part of the EU election observation mission to Peru in 2020, I observed first-hand the electoral system, which has delivered free and fair elections for over 20 years. We as the European Union stand ready to support the democratic system also in the future.

Vor drei Wochen hat der Auswärtige Ausschuss über die Lehren aus 20 Jahren Einsatz in Afghanistan beraten. Und eines war, glaube ich, fraktionsübergreifend klar: Die Europäische Union muss künftig in der Lage sein, eine Evakuierungsoperation wie die in Kabul im Jahr 2021 selbst durchzuführen. 
Genau solch einem Zweck dient diese schnelle Eingreiftruppe der Europäischen Union. Mit bis zu 5000 Soldaten, die je nach Bedarf zu Bodentruppen, Luft- oder Seestreitkräften gehören, wird die Eingreiftruppe auf den jeweiligen Krisenkontext zugeschnitten. So unterscheidet sie sich qualitativ und quantitativ von den EU Battlegroups, die zwar seit 2007 einsatzbereit waren und sind, aber aufgrund von mangelndem politischen Willen und fehlender finanzieller Solidarität leider nie entsandt wurden.
Damit die schnelle Eingreiftruppe nicht das gleiche Schicksal erfährt wie ihr Vorgängermodell, bleiben noch manche Fragen zu klären. Das betrifft besonders die Kostenteilung, die Anforderung zur Einsatzbereitschaft parallel zur NATO Response Force und die Befehlsstruktur. Die Mitgliedstaaten müssen die genauen Modalitäten jetzt zügig festlegen, idealerweise noch vor der ersten Übung in diesem Jahr. 
Am Ende, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, steht und fällt das Konzept mit dem echten politischen Willen der Mitgliedstaaten. Gemessen an den Hürden, die die europäische sicherheits- und verteidigungspolitische Zusammenarbeit bisher nehmen musste, ist die schnelle Eingreiftruppe ein Meilenstein. Darauf kann und sollte aufgebaut werden.

For the longest time, deep historic rifts between unionists and nationalists made any negotiations for lasting peace seemingly impossible. With the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement, we are celebrating a historic development that remains essential to peace and indeed reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
Dear colleagues, the true test of political leadership comes when it takes courage to lead against popular belief, and the peace process on the island of Ireland has known more than one courageous political leader. The Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement demonstrates it is possible to achieve great good in politics. Ever since 1998, we, as the European Union, we have worked alongside our UK and Irish partners to implement exactly this agreement. It was exactly in this spirit that we conducted the Brexit negotiations amid the rise of old questions of sovereignty and national identity. Preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland was and is an essential priority for the European Union.
Particularly in times of serious geopolitical challenges, a stable cooperation with the United Kingdom is so crucial. Much more unites us than divides us. As just mentioned by the Commission President, the Windsor Framework: with this Windsor Framework, we have found practical solutions to the challenges in the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland while maintaining the integrity of our EU single market. Indeed, the Windsor Framework offers a united way forward, but it also honours the historic achievements we are commemorating today. Together with our UK partners, let us use this momentum to walk the talk and to implement the solutions reached on paper.

In den letzten Monaten ist die Republik Moldau zunehmend zum Ziel russischer Einflussnahme geworden. Die wirtschaftliche Lage ist angespannt, das sicherheitspolitische Umfeld ist fragil. Moskau schränkt die Energieversorgung ein und versucht, die proeuropäische Regierung durch orchestrierte Proteste zu destabilisieren.
Das Ziel ist klar und das haben bereits viele Vorrednerinnen und Vorredner angesprochen. Der reformorientierte korruptionsbekämpfende und EU-freundliche Kurs soll untergraben werden. Der Regierung von Präsidentin Maia Sandu ist es trotz dieser widrigsten Umstände gelungen, ein ambitioniertes Reformprogramm voranzutreiben. Der im Juni 2022 erteilte Beitrittskandidatenstatus ist unser Versprechen an die langfristige europäische Perspektive der Republik Moldau.
Die Europäische Union muss und wird die Regierung in Chişinău in dieser schwierigen Lage weiterhin entschlossen und konsequent unterstützen. Es geht darum, die staatlichen Strukturen zu stabilisieren. Es geht darum, die wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen zu verbessern, und es geht darum, die Resilienz gegenüber russischer Desinformation zu stärken.
In diesem Zusammenhang, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, unterstütze ich ausdrücklich die Pläne, zügig eine zivile GSVP-Mission in das Land zu entsenden, um die moldauischen Strukturen im Krisenmanagement zu stärken. Das nächste Treffen der Europäischen Politischen Gemeinschaft findet am 1. Juni in Chişinău statt. Das wird ein wichtiger Anlass sein, der Republik Moldau die Unterstützung aller europäischen Partner zu zeigen.

Particularly at a time of serious geopolitical challenges, a stable and trustful cooperation is crucial. For this reason, like many other colleagues, I welcome the Windsor framework that was announced on 27 February. This is a welcome and long-awaited step in the right direction which should allow us to open a new chapter in our relationship.
Let me congratulate Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The agreement shows that practical and shared solutions to the challenges in the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland can be found. It highlights that joint efforts to find bilateral solutions to mitigate the consequences of Brexit can ensure stability and predictability for people and businesses in Northern Ireland, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of our EU single market.
The Windsor framework also reflects the EU’s long-standing commitment to protect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. The timely implementation of the solutions identified in the Windsor framework is key now. As the European Parliament, we will deliver on the legislative procedures as quickly as possible.
Let me also thank Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič and his team for the great work and for the excellent cooperation with Parliament. You can count on our continued support.

David McALLISTER,2023-01-19,EN,The Global Gateway Initiative (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-01-19-INT-4-055-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, more than one year has passed since the Commission put forward the Global Gateway – let me thank President Ursula von der Leyen for her leadership. In that one year, geopolitics have changed significantly, as many speakers have pointed out. It is now more important than ever to ensure that the European Union provides an instrument and an investment alternative to partner countries, including those receptive to Chinese and Russian influence.
The Global Gateway initiative offers long—term sustainable solutions to address joint priorities together with our partners. This is good for their development and it is also necessary to strengthen our own strategic sovereignty and competitiveness. Yes, the Global Initiative is an important geopolitical tool with large potential, but in order to make it effective, it is key to be geopolitically smart and strategic in our action and communication.
The choice of projects should be driven by two guiding questions: first, where does our offer to countries entail both a qualitative high positive offer to the partner country? And second, when does it help prevent malign influence by authoritarian countries? I welcome the groundwork that has been done over the past year, but now it is important to deliver as Team Europe, the EU institutions, the Member States, the EIB, the EBRD and the private sector need to come on board with their financing and with their expertise. The European Parliament should continue to stand ready to help make Global Gateway a success.

High Representative / Vice-President Josep Borrell, dear colleagues, I remember how we adopted last year’s common foreign and security policy report, it was on the 16th of February and just a few days later, the world changed significantly.
Since the 24th of February, war is back in Europe. We are living in a moment of geopolitical redefinition, as we have heard by previous speakers today already. The European Union’s swift, united and sustained response to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, and our ability to learn and address previous geostrategic mistakes, is a testament of the effectiveness of our common foreign security and defence policy. Indeed, the world has returned to the rules of power politics. As the European Union, we need to adapt to these realities, making sure that our objectives are consistent with our means. 
My report this year emphasises that the European Union should shape its common foreign and security policy in accordance with four general actions. 
First, the concept of strategic autonomy or strategic sovereignty, however you want to name it, needs to be put into practice. This can, inter alia, be done by swiftly and efficiently implementing the ambitious measures enshrined in the strategic campus. This can be done by reducing strategic dependencies. This can be done by enhancing the European Union’s resilience. But its action that speaks not words.
Second, the European Union should strengthen bilateral and multilateral partnerships for a better world. From our closest neighbours and allies to those who are far away but need us most, we should cooperate with partners to defend the rules based order and to maintain a principled position vis-à-vis those who exactly challenge our common values and principles.
Thirdly, to strengthen the European Union’s institutional and decision-making arrangements in foreign and security policy, we once again propose to turn to qualified majority voting progressively in all areas of the CFSP without military or defence implications. For instance, when it comes to the EU global human rights sanctions regime, also called the EU Magnitsky Act, using the passerelle clauses in Article 48 and Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union would be key. 
And finally, fourthly, we should do our best to enhance parliamentary diplomacy as one of the European Union’s foreign policy tools with a proven added value. 
To conclude, let me thank the shadow rapporteurs, all the involved staff from the groups and the Secretariat, and also dear Josep Borrell, the team of the High Representative for the once again constructive and fruitful cooperation. And I’m looking forward to carefully listening to the arguments in this debate.

Ich werde noch nicht einmal im Ansatz versuchen, die Debatte, die wir heute Nachmittag bzw. heute Abend hier geführt haben, zusammenzufassen. Ich möchte festhalten, dass ich hier sehr gute Wortbeiträge vieler Kolleginnen und Kollegen gehört habe. Ich gebe auch zu Protokoll, dass ich einige Wortmeldungen vom ganz linken Rand und vom ganz rechten Rand dieses Parlaments für außerordentlich befremdlich hielt und nach wie vor halte.
Ich möchte all das, was der Hohe Vertreter und Vizepräsident Josep Borrell gerade gesagt hat, unterstreichen. Und ich glaube, es ist wichtig, dass wir sowohl in der europäischen Außen- als auch in der europäischen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik, für die der Kollege Tom Vandenkendelaere den Bericht vorgelegt hat, versuchen – auch hier im Europäischen Parlament zwischen den konstruktiven Fraktionen –, ein hohes Maß an Übereinstimmung bereitzustellen. Ich will noch einmal an dieser Stelle sagen: Wir hatten wirklich gute Sitzungen der Schattenberichterstatter, haben uns durch viele, viele Anträge durchgearbeitet und am Ende ein gutes Werk gemeinsam hinbekommen. Nun haben wir morgen noch zu meinem Bericht zumindest 91 Änderungsanträge vorliegen, die in letzter Minute noch vorgelegt worden sind. Das ist eine relativ hohe Anzahl. Über die müssen wir jetzt alle noch abstimmen.
Gleichwohl hoffe ich, dass wir dieses hohe Maß an Geschlossenheit und Einheit in grundsätzlichen Fragen der europäischen Außen-, Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik hier im Parlament aufrechterhalten, auch um unserem Hohen Vertreter und Vizepräsidenten dann auch entsprechend die parlamentarische Unterstützung zu geben. Ich möchte mich ausdrücklich bei Josep Borrell bedanken, dass er die ganze Debatte über hier im Plenarsaal mit dabei gewesen ist.

The relations between the European Union and Latin America are not just a priority for some European countries because of their traditional bilateral relations: this partnership is a priority for the entire European Union as a whole and strategically important to strengthen the international rules—based order.
But colleagues, actions speak, not words, and to ensure that our efforts are credible, let us finally complete the modernisation of existing association agreements with Mexico and Chile. Let us finally sign the negotiated post—Cotonou Agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific community. Let us finally ratify the Association Agreement with Central America, and let us finally finalise the EU—Mercosur Agreement.
Trade plays an important role, yet these agreements are not just trade deals. These agreements are vehicles for a new and modernised agenda of cooperation. They are, in the end, a matter of credibility for our relationship and key to strengthening the European Union as a geopolitical actor.
Colleagues, actions speak, not words.

The European Parliament must conduct a policy of zero tolerance towards corruption. 
For this reason, I am appalled that four people closely connected to the European Parliament, including one of its vice presidents, were arrested by the Belgian authorities on suspicions of money laundering, corruption and participating in a criminal organisation. 
I very much welcome President Roberta Metsola’s leadership, her words yesterday, here in this hemicycle. I welcome her initiative to launch an internal investigation and a wide-ranging reform process. In order to increase transparency and to fight corruption, it is important that we now draw the right conclusions. 
Colleagues, the European Parliament cannot assume the role of a court and does not intend to prejudice ongoing investigations. Yet I congratulate the relevant Belgian and further European authorities on 14 further criminal actions through their work. Parliament should fully support the ongoing criminal investigation. For any foreign actor proven guilty in this ongoing case, there must also be swift and dissuasive consequences. 
The European Parliament needs to strengthen our anti-corruption mechanisms as well as defensive tools to combat foreign interference. Let me fully underline what colleagues have said. For time reasons, let me just add one additional point. In this case, a non-governmental organisation was allegedly used, or – to be more precise – misused as a vector of foreign interference in our political work. Therefore, we should also have a look at existing regulations in order to increase transparency and accountability of organisations and other actors.

Georgia belongs to Europe. But as we have heard tonight, to be granted EU candidate status, Georgia needs to successfully address the 12 key priorities indicated by the Commission. The Georgian bid for membership will continue to be assessed based on its own merits and its success in implementing all the necessary reforms. Unfortunately, the tense political situation hampers the country’s development. 
I want to make five remarks. First, political stakeholders need to refrain from any divisive and aggressive rhetoric, and unite their forces in order to increase trust among all political and institutional actors. Second, the excessive influence of vested interests in economic, political and public life needs to be eliminated. Third, Georgian authorities need to ensure media freedom. This entails editorial independence, transparent media ownership of pluralistic, impartial and non-discriminatory coverage of political views. Fourth, political leaders in Georgia must stop aggressive verbal attacks against Members of our European Parliament and representatives of other partner countries. 
And finally – and this is also personal for me – as Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I call on the Georgian authorities: please, please release former President Saakashvili and allow him to undergo proper medical treatment.

If the relationship between the two most advanced and integrated regional organisations in the world really is to be strategic, issues of concern to the one ought to be considered an issue of concern to the other. 
Having said that, tomorrow’s summit offers ample opportunity to strategise the elements of our future security and defence cooperation at a time when international law and maritime security are increasingly being subverted. Like the EU, ASEAN does not attempt to undermine multilateralism. We stand united in our conviction that trade and security should follow rules laid out in international agreements. With the EU being ASEAN’s third largest trading partner and its second largest investor, a region-to-region free trade agreement remains the common long-term objective. 
In the meantime, let us make full use of existing free trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore. I encourage further progress in the negotiations concerning the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Indonesia, and we should also remain open to a resumption of bilateral negotiations with Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines when, of course, right conditions are in place.

China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to actually do so. China will continue to be a major global player with whom the European Union must speak, work, trade and negotiate in areas of common and global interest. 
Therefore, High Representative/Vice-President, for this reason, the European Union’s engagement with China should be, as we have often pointed out, principled, practical and pragmatic. But at the same time, the European Union needs to stand firm in defending our values and interests. To reduce our vulnerabilities, to increase our resilience, to address our security concerns and to engage with our partners – from the more distant to the like—minded – are all important lines of action.

Kommissar Várhelyi hat gerade die Situation in Iran beschrieben; dem ist nichts hinzuzufügen. Das islamistische Mullah-Regime setzt Repression als Mittel zum eigenen Fortbestehen ein. Aber angesichts dieser Entwicklung, die der Kommissar beschrieben hat, muss aus meiner Sicht die Europäische Union endlich ihre Iranpolitik auf den Prüfstand stellen und den Druck auf das Regime weiter erhöhen. 
Der Iran steht möglicherweise vor den größten innenpolitischen und gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen seit 1979. Jetzt besteht die Chance, systematische Verbesserungen für die Lage der Frauen und einen gesellschaftlichen Wandel hin zu mehr Freiheit und Demokratie zu erreichen. Aber auf diesem Weg bedarf es der entschlossenen und tatkräftigen Unterstützung durch die Europäische Union. 
Herr Kommissar, ich bitte Sie: Wir müssen als Europäische Union die Protestbewegung, die Zivilgesellschaft im Iran stärker unterstützen. Die EU-Sanktionen müssen auf alle Personen und Organe des iranischen Regimes ausgeweitet werden, die an der Unterdrückung der aktuellen Proteste beteiligt sind, und die sogenannten Revolutionsgarden müssen EU-weit auf die Sanktionsliste gesetzt werden. 
Ich bin Präsidentin Roberta Metsola dankbar, dass sie einer Anregung der Koordinatoren im Ausschuss für auswärtige Angelegenheiten gefolgt ist, dass wir im Europäischen Parlament bis auf Weiteres keine direkten Kontakte mit offiziellen iranischen Gesprächspartnern werden stattfinden lassen. Das ist unsere Antwort auf die Sanktionierung von sechs Kolleginnen und Kollegen durch das Regime in Teheran.

David McALLISTER,2022-10-19,EN,EU-Western Balkans relations in light of the new enlargement package (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-215-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner Várhelyi, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has forced us to rethink our commitments and policies, including on enlargement. With Ukraine and Moldova having been granted candidate status and Georgia having been granted a European perspective, there are now ten countries in total that have embarked upon a path towards the European Union. 
Last Wednesday, we debated the 2022 enlargement package immediately after its adoption in an extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee, together with our Commissioner, Olivér Várhelyi. 
If I remember correctly, we more or less conveyed three messages. First, we highlighted the need to advance the EU enlargement policy as the single most effective instrument for securing peace, prosperity and fundamental values on the European continent. Second, we reiterated our strong support for the European perspective of the countries of the Western Balkans and underlined that the European Union needs to deliver on the obligations towards these countries. And, third, we emphasised that each enlargement country should be judged by its own and on its own merits. The enlargement process needs to remain firmly based on the fulfilment of all relevant criteria, with a strong focus on strengthening democracy, the rule of law, as well as on close cooperation on foreign policy matters. 
Commissioner Várhelyi, the Foreign Affairs Committee will continue to scrutinise the enlargement policy closely and we will now stock our work on the individual country reports.

David McALLISTER,2022-10-19,EN,Outcome of the first meeting of the European Political Community (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-378-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner Várhelyi, Minister Bek, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been a wake-up call for all of us. In this context, it is crucial that we intensify our relations with our strategic partners all over the globe, and especially with our like-minded neighbours in Europe.
In this regard, I very much welcome the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community. Minister Bek, let me thank the Czech Presidency for hosting, organising and making this event a success, děkuji.
This new platform has potential. The gathering of the 44 leaders delivered some concrete results, as Commissioner Várhelyi just mentioned. For example, the organisation of a civilian EU mission on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, or in the case of agreeing on a future bilateral summit between the United Kingdom and France. As such, the European Political Community can foster political dialogue for the benefit of our entire continent.
However, it is clear that the European Political Community cannot replace existing EU policies and instruments, notably enlargement. It has to fully respect the European Union’s decision-making autonomy. The European Political Community should not create a two-speed Europe.
Now, a strategic follow-up to a meeting in Prague is key to shape the future work of the EPC. This new format should be used to deliver concrete solutions to Europe’s most pressing issues.

The people are protesting against a deeply corrupt and violent regime that systematically oppresses women and responds to political resistance with brutal violence and repression. The violent crackdown of the mullahs security forces on peaceful protesters must stop immediately.
The Council ought to impose tough sanctions responding to serious human rights violations as soon as possible. Call them restrictive measures, call them tough sanctions – the main thing is they will be adopted; sooner, the better.
The regime in Tehran has manoeuvred itself into a dead end. As our President Roberta Metsola stated yesterday here in the plenary, we as the European Parliament stand in solidarity with the brave women and men and all their democratic aspirations in their fight for women’s, human and minority rights, for the free flow of information and access to Internet, and for a free, secular and democratic republic.

Coming back from these two countries, I would like to share a number of observations, perhaps six actions which I believe are key. 
First, we need to tackle the root causes of conflicts, extremism and radicalisation, such as terrorism, extreme poverty, the consequences of climate change and long—standing border disputes. Second, we need to strengthen the EU-CSDP missions and operations and to support peace processes under African ownership. Third, we need to support all diplomatic efforts towards ending the ongoing conflict within Ethiopia. Fourth, we need to counter Russian influence, such as the activities of the paramilitary Wagner Group in Sudan, as it has the potential to further destabilise the region. Fifth, we need to address the dependency of African states on Chinese investments. And six, we need to monitor very closely the total alignment of Eritrea with the Russian narrative and Russian propaganda. 
As Fabio Castaldo pointed out, the Horn of Africa is strategically important, and thus the European Union needs to strengthen its role in the region. Together with international and regional partners, let us integrate the trade, the development, the humanitarian and the conflict—prevention approaches to tackle the enormous challenges in this region.

In addition to these militarily threatening gestures, the communist government in Beijing is employing economic and political means, as well as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against Taiwan. But stability in the Taiwan Strait is directly linked to our European key interests of maintaining security, prosperity and freedom in the region. Yes, the European Union maintains the principled one-China policy, but we cannot tolerate unilateral attempts to modify the status quo, and even less so by resorting to force. In light of the continued military build-up, it remains very important for us as a European Union that we express our firm solidarity with the people of Taiwan, that we refuse to be intimidated or blackmailed by Beijing's provocations in the Taiwan Strait, and that we work together with our key partners such as the United States, South Korea, Australia and Japan to maintain peace and stability in the entire region.

As Mr López-Istúriz White’s report outlines, it is key to secure adequate resources for a timely and effective implementation of the new agenda for the Mediterranean. It is key to strengthen the EU’s dialogue in cooperation with the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, and it is key to address the impact of the Russian aggression against Ukraine on exactly these countries.
A strengthened Mediterranean partnership remains a strategic imperative for the European Union, simply because the challenges the region continues to face require a common response. And I would like to thank Commissioner Várhelyi for presenting a number of very concrete actions we are taking as a European Union. Only by acting together in a spirit of partnership can we turn common challenges and opportunities in our mutual interest.

As it dis—applies core elements of the Protocol in Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates more difficulties in Northern Ireland and undermines mutual trust. Unilateral actions deliberately contradicting an international agreement are not the way forward. 
The Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol, was and is the necessary foundation for the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The European Union’s reaction to the Northern Ireland Protocol bill has been proportionate, firm and calm – and rightly so, Vice—President Šefčovič.
We want to have stable and positive relations with the United Kingdom based on our agreements, mutually negotiated, signed and ratified by the United Kingdom and the European Union. We remain partners with shared values. Therefore, I call on the UK Government to re—enter talks to facilitate the practical implementation of the Protocol. The Protocol is not the problem – it is part of the solution to a problem. The original problem is, and remains, Brexit.

This war is a defining event for the future of our common foreign and security policy. Many challenges, as colleagues have already pointed out, lie ahead of us in this new era marked by increasing strategic competition, as well as a continued erosion of the rules-based international order. 
Indeed, the European Union should strengthen its role as a global champion for multilateralism. It is about making this system more relevant, resilient and effective. Moreover, as the European Union we need to intensify ties with our strategic partners, partners with whom we share the same values, partners with whom we can work together to promote and defend the rules-based international order with the United Nations at its heart. 
The European Parliament has a special role to play when it comes to parliamentary diplomacy and building global partnerships. Therefore, let us continue to develop our wide-ranging networks with third countries and international organisations to face common challenges. As Committee Chair, let me say to Jávi López, well done, your report will be voted tomorrow with a large majority.

It shall be named ‘The EU's foreign security and defence policy after the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine’. Colleagues, over the past weeks, we have used the term ‘war of aggression’ instead of ‘invasion’; therefore, I suggest to also change the title of this recommendation accordingly.

The issues raised by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine go far beyond the tragic situation we are currently witnessing: Europe as a whole is challenged.
For a very long time, our Parliament has been advocating for a stronger, more effective and more coherent common foreign security and defence policy. Now, Russia’s war against Ukraine shows us that the European Union has to equip itself urgently with the means and tools to respond to global strategic competition and also complex security threats. With our recommendation to the Council and the High Representative of the EU’s Foreign Security and Defence Policy, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we as Parliament assessed the recent EU initiatives in this field, and made concrete proposals for the way forward.
For us, eight key points should be taken into account at the meeting of the European Council on 23 and 24 June and at the following NATO summit in Madrid on 29 and 30 June. Namely, first, we recommend to work swiftly on the implementation of a strategic compass, in particular regarding the operational capability of the rapid deployment capacity.
Second, we recommend to review and strengthen CSDP missions and operations in order to adapt to the new geopolitical reality, and promptly as well as efficiently support the Ukrainian and Moldovan authorities.
Third, we recommend to swiftly finalise the work on a substantial third EU-NATO joint declaration and to ensure that the work on the strategic compass and the NATO strategic concept are aligned and lead to increased strategic complementarity.
Fourth, we recommend to review the European neighbourhood policy with the aim of thoroughly assessing the impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine on cooperation with the Eastern Partnership, and to strengthen the EU’s enlargement strategy.
Fifth, we recommend to involve the European Parliament appropriately in the further implementation of the CFSP and CSDP, including the strategic compass and the European Peace Facility.
Number six, we recommend to ensure that the EU security and defence policy is equipped with the necessary financial means in order to be more effective and credible.
Seventh, we recommend to provide Ukraine weapons and materiel in line with the needs expressed by the Ukrainian authorities and to grant the country EU candidate status as a clear political sign of solidarity with the courageous people of Ukraine.
And eighth, we recommend to ensure a comprehensive monitoring of all EU sanctions and to strengthen the Commission’s capacity to implement restrictive measures.
Dear colleagues, let me add a final extra point. The European Council has requested the presentation of a possible European joint defence investment programme at its meeting in two weeks. Clearly the European Parliament should welcome such a programme, and we should be closely involved in the preparations. Finally, allow me to propose a change to the title of this recommendation. Instead of ‘Russian invasion’, I suggest to change the wording to ‘Russia’s war of aggression’ in order to adapt the language of the report to all our recently adopted texts.
To conclude, let me thank the co-rapporteur, Nathalie Loiseau, as well as the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups for a really good, constructive and fruitful cooperation.

I would, first of all, like to thank all of you for an open, constructive and fruitful debate. We heard a lot of support and praise from the centre of the European Parliament and some criticism from the very far left and the very far right. I would like to share the observation of many MEPs, and I listened carefully, that we as a European Parliament are sending a strong message with this recommendation. 
The European Union indeed has to make genuine progress in the foreign policy and defence cooperation at the EU level, and this should include establishing a defence union with more ambitious, short, medium and long term objectives. As several colleagues mentioned in tonight’s debate, the European Union needs to implement the concrete actions laid down in the strategic compass, which would serve as a starting point for implementing common EU defence. 
Finally, the European Union needs to achieve strategic sovereignty and increase its ability to act in today’s moment of geopolitical redefinition. Colleagues, Russia’s war against Ukraine is not only attack on Ukraine, it is indeed an attack on the entire peace and security architecture and order in Europe. For this reason, for this reason, it is high time that we enhance the healing and the effectiveness of our foreign security and defence policy. Let us do this with determination substantially and in close cooperation with our partners.

David McALLISTER,2022-06-06,EN,The EU and the security challenges in the Indo-Pacific (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-06-INT-1-118-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  rapporteur. – Mr President, the Indo-Pacific has become one of the centres of geopolitical gravity and a rallying point for many global players. Its growing economic, demographic and political weight makes it an increasingly important region in shaping the international order. Therefore, the European Union must increase its efforts and step up its strategic engagement with the region. 
Last year, first the Council adopted conclusions on an EU strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and then the High Representative presented a communication in September last year which reflects the European Union's efforts and ambitions. Tomorrow, we are going to vote in this plenary on the report on the security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. This report, from my point of view, assesses the EU strategy with regard to the security dimension, taking into account national strategies and new developments. Generally, my report focuses on four parts that are of key importance. 
First, in security and defence for unity among Member States will be key for the EU to assert effectively our presence in the Indo-Pacific and to achieve the ambition of strategic sovereignty amidst the increasing competition among global and regional powers in the region. In the absence of an overarching security architecture in the Indo-Pacific, the European Union should concentrate its efforts on maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific for all and on promoting an open and rules-based regional security architecture. 
Second, our united approach to the region must also go hand-in-hand with targeted actions aimed at building strong partnerships and security cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries and regional cooperation forums. To do so, we should build on a vast network of trade, partnership and cooperation agreements concluded with a large number of regional countries in the past. A close coordination with our partners in the region is especially important in order to tackle the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. 
The third point: Europe and the countries of the Indo-Pacific share increasingly similar challenges in a number of other security-related areas, such as cyber security, terrorism and non-proliferation. As all these challenges directly affect the EU's own security and prosperity, we need to address them in close cooperation and coordination with regional partners. A particular focus should be given to our key partners and like-minded democracies. Let me name Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. 
Last but not least, the report highlights the necessity to tackle maritime security, cyber, air and space, as well as non-traditional security challenges. 
To conclude, let me thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the different political groups and also the team of the High Representative for a really good, constructive and fruitful cooperation on where drafting and working on this report.

I would like to thank all colleagues for their contributions. I thought this was a constructive debate and having listened carefully to all the contributions, let me try to summarise. I guess most of us do agree that for us in the European Union, the Indo-Pacific offers great opportunities, but indeed also poses many challenges. But one thing is clear: our prosperity and economic interests rely on the openness for stability and the security in the region.
 Several colleagues mentioned increasing geopolitical competition. Well, yes, this does produce tensions not only in trade and supply chains, but also in broader political and security matters. It is authoritarian regimes in the region that are suppressing democratic principles and human rights and this, in the end, puts regional stability at risk and this also directly affects European security and prosperity. 
From my point of view, the key message the European Parliament is sending to the entire Indo-Pacific is that we are ready – ready for deepening cooperation and engagement with our partners and like-minded countries, like-minded democracies in the region, in order to respond to emerging dynamics that are affecting regional but also global stability and security. 
To sum up, it is in our joint interest to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific for all, and it is in our interest to promote a rules-based regional order in line with the principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and international law.
I would like to thank once again for the support I received from most of the political groups yesterday, and I am quite convinced that tomorrow we can adopt this report with a large and broad majority in this plenary. Once again, dear colleagues, thank you for a fruitful and constructive debate.

The country has been disproportionally affected by the recent events. I condemn all provocations and attempts to involve Moldova in actions that could endanger peace in the country. The EU must be ready to provide more humanitarian, security and socio-economic assistance to the Republic of Moldova, the longer the Russian war against Ukraine lasts. This includes: increasing the financial and technical assistance, including through a new proposal for macro-financial assistance; putting forward additional proposals aimed at ensuring the full liberalisation of transport and trade with the EU; working towards granting EU candidate status to the Republic of Moldova, in line with Article 49 of the Treaty of the European Union and on the basis of merit; in the meantime, working towards the full implementation of the Association Agreement with Moldova and its integration into the EU single market. The Moldovan authorities under President Maia Sandu are on the right track by adopting key reforms that will ensure Moldova´s compliance with the ‘Copenhagen criteria’. Let us provide our full support to Moldova’s European aspirations.

Der barbarische Angriffskrieg gegen die Ukraine bedeutet, wie mehrere Vorredner es bereits betont haben, eine Zeitenwende. Die Gewissheiten der letzten drei Jahrzehnte seit 1990 haben ihre Gültigkeit endgültig verloren, die Welt der Mächtekonkurrenz ist zurück. Als Europäer müssen wir wieder lernen, für unsere Werte zu streiten, unsere Interessen in der Welt zu benennen und durchzusetzen.
Um unsere Freiheit, Sicherheit und Versorgung dauerhaft zu sichern, braucht Europa einen Realitätscheck. Ja, wir benötigen dringend eine grundlegende Neuausrichtung unserer Außen-, Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik. Dafür gilt es, eben genau diese gemeinsame Außen-, Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik effektiver zu gestalten. Das Europäische Parlament hat mit großen Mehrheiten seit Jahren konkrete Vorschläge dazu gemacht, zuletzt während der Plenardebatte und der Plenarsitzung hier in Straßburg, wo die beiden Berichte verabschiedet wurden. Lasst uns jetzt endgültig konkrete Schritte hin zu einer europäischen Verteidigungsunion gehen – eng abgestimmt mit unseren Nachbarn, eng abgestimmt mit unseren NATO-Partnern –, und zwar schnell und engagiert.

It is unprovoked. It is unjustified. This is indeed a crucial and historical moment, the moment of truth, as Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pointed out. 
Too many times in the past, the international community has been blind in front of unfolding tragedies. Today, we as a European Parliament are sending a strong and a united message to the Kremlin that we stand with Ukraine in full solidarity. 
As Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I would like to thank the colleagues from the different political groups who drafted and negotiated this resolution, and I call on colleagues to vote in favour. 
I fully underline the very good arguments we have heard today. I want to add one point. Let us also strongly condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine. It was during last week’s inter-parliamentary conference on the CFSP and CSDP in Paris that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya made it very clear that the assault on Ukraine wouldn’t have been possible if dictator Lukashenko wouldn’t have provided Russia with the land and the infrastructure. The Lukashenko regime has assisted and enabled this Russian aggression. For this reason, the EU should apply further appropriate sanctions also on Belarus. 
Dear colleagues, the world will hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their actions.

And this is why we must stand together in this crucial moment.
As the European Parliament, we will not waver in our support of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally-recognised borders. Ukraine has a sovereign right to choose its international alliances freely. The Russian Federation must cease its military threat against Ukraine and immediately, as well as fully, withdraw its forces and military equipment from the border of Ukraine. Any further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive and unprecedented consequences and severe costs in response, including restrictive measures coordinated with our international partners.
It is on the Kremlin to de-escalate and to engage constructively through established mechanisms. The double track of diplomatic engagement and deterrence remains key to solving the current situation.
A final remark: following Monday’s vote to apply an urgent procedure, we are now, this noon, set to give the green light to an emergency EUR 1.2 billion loan to Ukraine to cover its external financing needs in 2022. This demonstrates our solidarity and support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.

At the same time, not a single EU Member State can respond effectively to today’s global challenges on its own. Therefore, as the European Union, we need to achieve the strategic goal of developing our global leadership role. 
There are five takeaways from my report.
First, the EU needs to take the lead in promoting global partnerships and a strong multilateral system. We should promote alliances of democracies worldwide and pool our resources to counter malign interferences by authoritarian states. We need to develop our partnerships in the areas of conflict prevention and conflict resolution, and should build alliances based on our Green Deal. 
Second, we need to improve the way the European Union takes decisions in the field of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Unanimity hampers the EU’s ability to act. I would like to encourage EU Member States to switch to qualified majority, at least in some areas of the CFSP. It is also necessary to strengthen the existing EU toolbox, for example, by better combining all assets we have as the EU on the international scene. 
Third, we need to ensure our strategic sovereignty in fundamental areas, including by reducing our dependencies in key technological areas, critical infrastructures and supply chains. It is also about establishing a European Defence Union. The new Strategic Compass, which hopefully, High Representative, will be adopted at the end of March, should guide the way forward. 
Fourth, we need to develop coherent regional EU strategies for our relations with different parts of the world. In this respect, I welcome the High Representative / Vice-President’s endeavours to propose clear frameworks with well-defined ambitions and objectives for our relations with different partners in the world, such as the new indo-pacific strategy and the announced joint communication on a partnership with the Gulf. 
Fifth, democracy is at the heart of our foreign and security policy. Therefore, we need to strengthen the democratic oversight, scrutiny and accountability, as well as the parliamentary dimension, of the common foreign and security policy.
I look forward to today’s debate and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs – and also the team of the High Representative – for the really good, constructive and fruitful cooperation during the last weeks while working on this report.

I would like to thank all colleagues for this open and constructive debate, which lasted more than two hours. I believe it is a strong signal that most of the colleagues I listened to in this House act in concert towards a stronger common foreign and security policy. 
The challenges of the 21st century call for more, not less, EU action on the global scene. These challenges call for more, not less, multilateral governance and rules-based international cooperation. 
We just heard the High Representative conclude our debate. I believe that also we should make our EU common foreign and security policy more efficient, more coherent, more flexible and at the same time, democratic, accountable and transparent. Achieving leadership as the European Union in international affairs in the end requires a strong will and decisive steps in 2022, such as the EU Strategic Compass. I sincerely hope that this will have significant added value for our common foreign and security policy and solidarity among Member States. 
Once again, thank you so much, also on behalf of Nathalie Loiseau, for this interesting debate. And now we can move on to the next point of order.

David McALLISTER,2021-12-14,EN,The situation in Nicaragua (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-14-INT-2-139-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Mr President, the elections on 7 November in Nicaragua violated all international democratic standards for credible, inclusive, fair and transparent elections. They were a sad climax of Nicaragua’s continuous authoritarian development as they complete the conversion of this country into an autocratic regime. As the European Parliament, we reject the legitimacy of the results of these fake elections and, therefore, we reject the democratic legitimacy of any institutional authorities emerged from this rigged vote. 
The systematic crackdown of opposition leaders, journalists and civil society actors, as well as the psychological and physical abuse of the Nicaraguan people, are appalling and represent a clear breach of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. High Representative / Vice-President, indeed we need to consider all instruments at our disposal to take additional measures against the Ortega regime. 
I call on the Nicaraguan authorities to end repression, to uphold and respect human rights, and to allow the Nicaraguan people to exercise their civil and political rights. I call on the Nicaraguan authorities to hold elections in accordance with international parameters which comply with international standards and the Inter-American Democratic Charter to realise the democratic aspirations of the people of this country. And I call on the Nicaraguan authorities to allow international as well as civil society organisations to access the country without restrictions. For the European Union has consistently called for free and fair transparent elections, for the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and for the immediate and unconditional release of arbitrarily detained political prisoners.
Mr Ortega, return the sovereignty of Nicaragua to the Nicaraguan people, who are its rightful owners.

Die humanitäre Lage an der Grenze zwischen Polen und Belarus bietet Anlass zu sehr großer Sorge. Die derzeitige Krise ist ein von Herrn Lukaschenka und Herrn Putin koordinierter Angriff auf die Europäische Union.
Menschen nach Minsk einfliegen zu lassen, gewaltvoll an die EU-Grenze zu treiben und sie für politische Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren, ist eine skrupellose Methode. Daher begrüße ich den jüngsten Vorschlag der Kommission, der eine schwarze Liste für alle Verkehrsmittel und Transportarten auf der Grundlage der völkerrechtlichen Vereinbarungen über Menschenhandel und Schleuserkriminalität umfasst.
Die Europäische Union darf sich nicht erpressbar machen. Nur mit Geschlossenheit können wir autoritären Herrschern gegenübertreten!
Die Migranten an der EU-Außengrenze müssen dringend humanitär versorgt werden. Dass die Menschen bei bitterer Kälte verharren müssen, ist unerträglich und zeigt einmal mehr die Brutalität des Regimes in Minsk. Es ist gut, dass die Europäische Union konkret Hilfe leistet und gemeinsam mit den UN-Agenturen die Menschen vor Ort unterstützt.

Nachdem verschiedene Entwicklungen der jüngeren Vergangenheit das grundsätzlich positive Verhältnis der EU mit den USA zuletzt belastet hatten, war dies eine weitere positive Nachricht. Die USA sind und bleiben unser wichtigster strategischer Verbündeter.
Ebenso ist positiv, dass der neue Handels- und Technologierat vor gut einem Monat hoffnungsvoll gestartet ist. Ein intensiver Dialog stärkt das gegenseitige Vertrauen und Verständnis. Wir haben gemeinsame Interessen und stehen vor enormen Herausforderungen, auf die wir uns konzentrieren sollten. So werden wir nach gemeinsamen Lösungen für die Lücken in den Lieferketten für Halbleiter suchen. Die globale Halbleiterversorgungskrise ist vermutlich der größte Bremsklotz für die wirtschaftliche Erholung nach der Pandemie und kostet schon jetzt Arbeitsplätze, gerade auch in Deutschland. Die EU und die USA sollten dieses Problem zusammen angehen.
Der Handels- und Technologierat sollte weitere drängende Fragen behandeln. Dazu zählen beispielsweise gemeinsame Regeln für Künstliche Intelligenz oder die Plattformökonomie, sowie unser Verhältnis zu China. Hier sollten wir uns strategisch enger mit Washington abstimmen. Jetzt gilt es, den Schwung des ersten Treffens mitzunehmen und die transatlantische Zusammenarbeit zu stärken.

With the visit of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month and the EU Western Balkans Summit two weeks ago in Brdo, the European Union has once again demonstrated its strong political commitment to the Western Balkan countries and the entire accession process. 
Having a closer look at the Brdo declaration, I would see five important positive messages to our partners. 
Firstly, it is reconfirmed the European perspective of the region and our commitment to enlargement. Secondly, the EU has provided EUR 3.3 billion for emergency support and for supporting the recovery. In addition, the EU together with the Member States, has delivered almost three million doses of vaccines already. 
Thirdly, the heads of state have called for a swift implementation of the economic and investment plan and the new IPA III regulation. Fourthly, other very practical measures were agreed to associate the region more closely to us in the European Union, such as to lower roaming charges. And fifthly, the European Union reaffirmed its support to strengthen regional cooperation. 
Recent concerning events have shown how deep the divisions run and how much work is still needed to build good and sustainable neighbourly relations. Allow me to thank Commissioner Várhelyi for presenting the enlargement package yesterday at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. During our discussion, we welcomed the restated commitment of the Western Balkans partners to the primacy of democracy, fundamental rights and values. 
EU support must continue to be linked to tangible progress on the rule of law and socio—economic reforms, as well as to the adherence of our European values, rules and standards. 
A final point: as we enter a critical juncture for the future of the EU and its enlargement, the EU and the Member States must clear the hurdles precluding us from switching gears in the accession process for countries that show a strong commitment to reforms.

Anna Fotyga, Željana Zovko, Urmas Paet and Andreas Schieder will probably agree; our visit demonstrated that the unique complexity of the challenges on the ground requires more engagement and solutions based on the knowledge and the will of the people living in the Arctic. 
Furthermore, there is an urgent need for constructive international cooperation to counter emerging threats to stability in the entire High North. For this reason, I welcome the adoption of our timely report. Let me thank Anna Fotyga for her good work and I do hope, Commissioner Breton, that the Commission and the High Representative / Vice—President will soon present an ambitious new joint communication which takes our main messages into account. These are: to respond ambitiously to climate change and safeguarding the Arctic environment, to promote sustainable development and to strengthen international cooperation in order to address all the geopolitical challenges in the High North. 
The Foreign Affairs Committee will keep the Arctic high on its agenda. Yes, indeed, there should be more EU in the Arctic and more Arctic in the EU.

It is clear that we have to go beyond just expressing our concerns.
First, of course it is about providing immediate humanitarian assistance for all those people in need in Afghanistan in order to stabilise the whole region and to prevent a migration crisis. Second, we need to identify a coherent strategy and develop a united approach at EU level, together with our international partners, on how to deal with the de facto rulers in Kabul, the Taliban. Third, international cooperation with our allies and partners is necessary to ensure regional stability and global security. The risk of resurgence of radical Islamist forces in Afghanistan is real.
As Europeans, I strongly believe we have to draw serious lessons learned for the nature and mandate of future military interventions. We need to strengthen our own defence cooperation and military capabilities, such as our intelligence and strategic airlift capacities. Doing this should always go hand—in—hand with close transatlantic cooperation. In this regard, I welcome the recent initiative of the High Representative and Vice—President.

The modernised instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA III) paves the way for improved governance, for coherence and for transparency of our external funding in this crucial period of our enlargement policy.
Commissioner Várhely, I do hope that IPA III can improve our visibility as the European Union in the region and bring a tangible impact on the ground through enhanced conditionality. Allow me to thank and include all the involved staff, the negotiators of the Council, Commissioner Olivér Várhelyi and, of course, our co-rapporteurs, Željana Zovko and Tonino Picula, for their dedication and their tireless work, in particular during the occasionally rather challenging trilogues.
Together, we have achieved a very good outcome. This is a remarkable achievement. Thank you so much.

Meine sehr verehrten Damen, sehr geehrte Herren! Unser Berichterstatter Pascal Arimont hat es soeben sehr zutreffend auf den Punkt gebracht: Mit dem Brexit gehen viele negative soziale und wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen für die Menschen, für die Unternehmen und auch für die öffentlichen Verwaltungen einher. 
Ich begrüße diese 5 Milliarden Euro schwere Reserve für die Anpassung an den Brexit sehr, weil, das wichtig für die Regionen Europas ist, die besonders von den Folgen des Brexits betroffen sind. Es geht darum, Unternehmen bei der Anpassung an neue Grenz-, Zoll- und Kontrollregelungen zu unterstützen. Und es geht vor allen Dingen um Hilfen für Branchen, die vom Handel mit dem Vereinigten Königreich ganz besonders abhängig sind. Viele Unternehmen mussten hohe, teils unvorhergesehene Einbußen verzeichnen.
Die Fischerei ist der verhältnismäßig am stärksten betroffene Wirtschaftszweig. Das ist natürlich eine Folge der reduzierten Fangrechte im Ärmelkanal, in der Nordsee und im Nordatlantik. Auch für die Fischwirtschaft und für die Standorte Cuxhaven und Bremerhaven in meiner norddeutschen Heimat ist es nun wichtig, dass diese finanziellen Mittel zügig und unbürokratisch vor Ort ankommen.

The latest developments are yet another step away from achieving a peaceful and democratic solution to the political, economic and social crisis in that country.
I call upon the Nicaraguan Government to make immediate changes to the electoral law in accordance with the international parameters demanded by the Organization of American States. I call upon the Nicaraguan Government to guarantee transparent, free and fair elections in accordance with international standards. And I call on the Nicaraguan Government to release, immediately and unconditionally, all arbitrarily detained political prisoners, among them the pre—presidential candidate and the opposition leaders.
Dear Josep Borrell, the Council should quickly enlarge the list of sanctions against individuals and entities and include President Ortega, Vice—President Murillo and their inner circle.

Therefore, I welcome last year’s adoption of the EU global human rights sanctions regime, which some of us in this House prefer to call simply the EU Magnitsky Act. 
This regime should be part of a coherent and clearly defined strategy that considers the foreign policy objectives of the EU. It needs to reflect new challenges and threats to human rights violations such as corruption, abuse of state emergency powers or violence against human rights defenders. 
We as the European Parliament would like to see an efficient and consistent use of the sanctions regime, with decisions in the Council taken by the qualified majority vote. With this in mind, I would like to address the High Representative and the European Commission with the following questions. 
Number one: what are the experiences in implementing the EU global human rights sanctions regime? What is its place in the EU’s external policy toolbox and how does it relate to other EU sanctions frameworks? 
Number two: how are the uniformity of criteria and consistency ensured in the regime’s implementation, especially with regard to the listing and delisting of persons, entities and bodies? 
Number three: how does the European External Action Service plan to involve Parliament? 
Number four: will the European External Action Service (EEAS) set up an EU-level advisory committee and outline guidelines for the involvement of civil society organisations in proposing and providing evidence? Does the EEAS envisage a mechanism for protecting those organisations or individuals? 
Number five: would the Commission consider enlarging the scope of the regime, taking into account the United Kingdom’s new global anti-corruption sanctions regime? 
Number six: would the External Action Service and the Commission be ready to reintroduce the proposal to use qualified majority voting to impose sanctions? 
And finally, question number seven: what cooperation has been undertaken with like—minded countries? What will be done to ensure close cooperation and consistency with external judicial institutions and international supervisory and monitoring structures in implementing the regime?

David McALLISTER,2021-05-18,EN,EU strategy towards Israel-Palestine (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-05-18-INT-2-205-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, the grave and ongoing escalation in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territory, including the major upsurge in violence against Israel and in and around Gaza, is extremely worrying and must stop now. It has claimed the lives of so many innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians, including children on both sides. The rocket attacks by the terror organisation Hamas have no justification and put the lives of innocent people at great risk. They must stop immediately.
Israel has a right and Israel has a duty to defend its citizens against terror attacks. I call on the Israeli Government to act with restraint and to do its utmost to avoid civilian casualties. As Minister Santos Silva just underlined, the European Union is actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to help defuse the violence. We should pursue close dialogue with the United States, but also with partners like Egypt and Jordan on an immediate and lasting ceasefire. Meaningful direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians towards a long—lasting and fair agreement on the two—state solution based on the internationally agreed parameters need to restart. The European Union and the United States should cooperate closely together in the Middle East Quartet to create the conditions for renewed confidence between the two negotiating parties.
Finally, let me be very clear. Yes, one can criticise Israel’s politics but there is no justification for anti—Semitism, hatred and violence, not on this continent and not in the European Union, which is committed to freedom of religion and human rights for all our citizens. Anti—Semitism in any form is unacceptable, anti—Semitic violence must be punished with the full force of law.

However, as we have also heard, further reforms as regards the rule of law, the judiciary, media freedom and the fight against corruption remain essential.
The elections on 30 August last year resulted in the first transition of power since the introduction of the multiparty system in this country. Just 2 months ago in the Foreign Affairs Committee we have discussed the first 100 days of a new government with the new deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, Mr Dritan Abazović. I welcome his clear commitment and pledge to keep a pro-EU and a pro-NATO course. This should be the position of all parties in the government.
Our priority and what will be key now is to deepen and to speed up reforms, particularly with regard to the rule of law, where the next milestone ahead is meeting the benchmarks under the rule of law and fundamental freedoms Chapters 23 and 24. To overcome the socio-economic crisis due to the pandemic, which has hit Montenegro particularly hard, the EU is ready to continue its support because, as Commissioner Olivér Várhelyi said, we care about our partners.

For this reason, the news we are hearing from India about the critical situation related to COVID—19 in the country is so shocking. The European Union, in close cooperation with Member States, as we just heard, is mobilising support and assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to help our trusted partner. It is crucial to quickly support India in these critical days.
I believe the full potential of our relations with India should finally be unleashed. It is about accelerating and strengthening the strategic partnership – a strategic partnership based on common values and principles, as well as on joint interests. With the roadmap to 2025, agreed on in July last year, there is a solid basis to do so; now it needs to be further implemented.
The EU–India leaders meeting on 8 May, as mentioned by the rapporteur and the Commissioner, will be a good occasion to take stock of the progress achieved so far and to intensify our future cooperation. Four areas will be key: global health issues, climate change and sustainable growth, technology, trade and investment, and foreign security and defence.
A final remark: India is an important partner for the EU when it comes to preserving and promoting the rules—based multilateral order. Therefore, let us improve our cooperation on geopolitical challenges, especially in the Pacific and in international organisations. The upcoming summit should create positive momentum and clear steps to deepen our strategic partnership. This is the expectation of the EPP.

The political situation in the country has rapidly deteriorated. Therefore, I support the efforts of all facilitators to relaunch and strengthen dialogue between the Opposition and the Government. 
Georgia is indeed facing numerous challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic development, social cohesion and security. Therefore, political leaders need to overcome this political crisis quickly and to find long—term solutions together. The way forward should include an ambitious electoral reform, a rule of law and court reform, also addressing politicised justice, power sharing in parliament, including the setting up of the investigative commission and potentially new elections, and also the preparation for the local elections planned for autumn this year.
As the High Representative just mentioned, next week’s EU-Georgia Association Council in Brussels will hopefully state some progress that has been made in the dialogue. Let me wish the newly appointed envoy, Christian Danielsson, and also our EU Ambassador in Tbilisi, Carl Hartzell, and their teams all the best in overcoming the current political tensions in this great country.

In a number of resolutions throughout the last few years we have, for instance, strongly condemned all past and present human rights violations, especially against the Rohingya population. 
Since 2015, and previous speakers have underlined this, the European Union has politically and financially supported Myanmar’s process of democratic transition. We have undertaken enormous efforts to promote peace, human rights and development in this country. 
Unfortunately, all these positive developments have been abruptly reversed by the recent coup. This coup was a clear violation of Myanmar’s constitution, which we ought to all strongly condemn. I am deeply concerned by the detention of political leaders and civil society activists, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. 
I call upon the military to immediately end the state of emergency. I call on the military to restore power to the democratically elected government. I call upon the military to respect human rights and the rule of law, and I call upon the military to release all those unjustly detained. 
The November election results, as well as the Constitution, must be respected, and the national parliament should be convened at the earliest opportunity. Power should be returned to democratically elected representatives and to a civilian government as soon as possible. 
For the European Union, all instruments should be on the table in order to react. As the European Parliament, we should send a strong message that we stand with the people of Myanmar who want to see a democratic future of their country. 
High Representative, thank you for your good words on this issue.

President Biden deserves all the best wishes for the enormous challenges that are lying ahead of him. Today’s inauguration certainly opens a new chapter for our American friends, but it also opens a new chapter in our transatlantic relations, which have been under such tremendous pressure since 2017. Strategic goals are important. They are crucial for our relations, to renew the trust that is at the heart of our alliance, to agree on a common strategy to address global challenges, and to adapt our political, military, technological and economic cooperation, so that we have the most effective alliance for protecting freedom, securing peace and supporting a rules-based order in an increasingly challenging world.
As Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pointed out this morning, there are certainly massive challenges we should tackle jointly, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic recovery, trade and digital technology, climate change and, of course, foreign policy and security issues. So let us give a fresh impetus to our transatlantic relations. Things can only get better, and I am convinced they will get better.

As we heard this morning, important priorities are on your agenda, such as tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring Europe’s economic recovery. Colleagues, I welcome in particular the fact that Portugal has decided to focus strongly on external affairs in the upcoming months. As we discussed yesterday with the High Representative during the debate on our common foreign and security policy, strengthening multilateralism and affirming the European Union as a global player is today more important than ever, and our Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is leading a geopolitical Commission, and this for good reasons. 
Prime Minister, the proposals from the Portuguese Presidency to strengthen the EU’s relations with India, with the African continent, and indeed with Latin America, especially Mercosur, are a key step in promoting the role of the European Union on the global stage. The next months will also be decisive in establishing a fruitful cooperation with the United Kingdom and with the new administration in the United States. For all these priorities I wish her success. The Committee on Foreign Affairs is looking forward to working closely together with the Portuguese Government.

The arrest of Mr Navalny and its modalities clearly contravene international law and the Russian constitution. I urge the authorities in Moscow to release him and his supporters immediately. Their rights need to be fully and unconditionally respected and enforced. 
These latest developments further deteriorate the already strained relations between the European Union and Russia. The intimidation and political persecution of government critics in Russia must stop. Dear Josep Borrell, I am thankful for your strong and clear words immediately after the arrest of Mr Navalny, and again this afternoon. Indeed, the politicisation of the Russian judiciary is unacceptable. 
The poisoning and the arrest of Mr Navalny are just the latest of many arguments to reassess our relations with Russia. As the European Union, we should be very clear in our response and expand the so far introduced sanctions to individuals implicated in his arrest and those who gave orders to do so. As of December 2020, the EU has the instrument of a global human rights sanctions regime. We shouldn’t hesitate to use this tool when and where necessary.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have severe economic, social and political consequences. It also had and has geopolitical consequences, and they will inevitably affect key aspects of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The last year has reminded us that the European security environment is today more volatile, more unpredictable, more complex and more ambiguous than at any time since the end of the Cold War.
Potential threats have become reality, and in the wake of a global pandemic, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms are deteriorating in many parts of the world. Disinformation campaigns and cyber-attacks have increased, isolationist trends and competition between major international actors are on the rise.
Let me underline three main findings of my annual Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) report.
Firstly, the European Union should position itself as a partner of choice in a changing geopolitical order. We are living in a weakened global system where multilateralism is being heavily attacked. It is essential to quickly adopt and adjust our European response to this new geopolitical reality.
The European Union is a partner of choice for third parties guided by the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are a reliable actor and mediator in conflict resolution, but also a leader in promoting multilateral frameworks. However, too often, the European Union was and is divided, lacking the necessary weight and credibility to have a decisive impact on the geopolitical developments.
A second point: a new level of ambition is required to shape the CFSP. What the European Union needs, first and foremost, is a genuine political will from all Member States to jointly push our common foreign policy goals and counter third countries’ attempts to divide us. 
There is still a large untapped potential in combining and integrating all strands of the European Union’s external actions, hard power and soft power to achieve our common goals.
And thirdly, concrete steps are necessary to strengthen the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy and thereby our global influence. We need to consolidate our strategic alliances with like-minded partners across the world, and also diversify our cooperation on an ad hoc basis.
We need to reinforce our strategic sovereignty and need a common understanding of what this actually means. We need a quicker and more effective decision-making process. 
This means, for example, as often discussed in this plenary, to move from a unanimity to qualified—majority voting at least in selected areas of CFSP or to consider additional formats to improve our external actions such as a European Security Council.
On our common security and defence policy, we need to strengthen the capacity at EU and also at Member State level to establish a fully-fledged defence union. 
Finally, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and our external actions as a whole require appropriate financial resources. In this regard, I welcome the breakthrough in the trilogue concerning the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument to name just one.
All financial instruments including the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) III and others need to be finalised and become operative soon.
Dear colleagues, to conclude, no single EU Member State can respond effectively to today’s global challenges on its own. We must continue to strengthen our Common Foreign and Security Policy, we must continue to reinforce our global influence and we must continue to enhance our capacity to act.
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the good, constructive and fruitful cooperation on finalising this document and, dear High Representative Vice-President, let me also thank you personally and your team for the helpful support in writing down all these parts of this report.

David McALLISTER,2020-12-18,EN,Future Relations between the EU and the UK (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-12-18-INT-5-009-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, as we have just heard, in less than two weeks the United Kingdom will leave the single market and the customs union and yet, until now, both sides have not been able to agree on our future partnership as of 1 January. The negotiations have indeed been intense and tough. They take place in an unprecedented environment and under extreme time pressure. The European Union has never negotiated an agreement with a third country of such scope, and only in nine months.
Let me first of all thank Vice—President Maroš Šefčovič and our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and their two teams, for their tireless work and the very good close and regular cooperation with the European Parliament, in particular during the recent weeks. The best solution for both sides would certainly be to reach a comprehensive agreement before the end of the year. This would provide clarity and this would provide predictability to citizens and businesses.
Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents emphasised that we, as the European Parliament, stand ready to organise an extraordinary plenary session towards the end of December, in case an agreement is finalised by midnight this Sunday. We stand ready to debate the outcome of the negotiations intensively as soon as possible, and we stand ready to thoroughly scrutinise the final text. But, one thing has to be very clear: this would be a unique scenario and cannot and will not serve as a precedent for future agreements.
There is a narrow path to an agreement, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday here in the plenary. Indeed, I welcome the substantial progress made on many issues. However, as we heard this morning, differences remain to be bridged, in particular on fisheries, and we all know this will be very challenging.
Since it is still not clear whether there will be an agreement in the end, we simply have to be prepared for all scenarios. The four targeted and time—limited contingency measures we will adopt today aim at limiting some of the most severe consequences in areas where no fall—back solutions exist. 
Disruption will happen with or without an agreement. This is the natural consequence of the British decision to leave the European Union and to no longer participate in our single market and customs union. I remain convinced that it is in our mutual interest to agree on a sustainable, a trustful and a balanced partnership with the United Kingdom, which is one of our closest partners and an ally.

And indeed, this is still valid today, and it is in particular valid for the EU’s strategy on the COVID-19 vaccination. This pandemic constitutes a challenge around the world. Consequently, it has to be tackled globally and by international cooperation. Most crucial is that we follow a systematic and coordinated global approach that focuses on international cooperation with like-minded partners to ensure universal and timely access to a vaccine and also focuses on solidarity with the most vulnerable countries to facilitate access to vaccines in a fair manner for all people across the world.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up call for the need for a strong and more united EU foreign security policy. It is high time for us as the European Union to promote more decisively our values and our interests worldwide. Our COVID-19 vaccination strategy will be an important component on the way to this goal.

We have heard this morning that both teams are working tirelessly, day and night, as well as over the weekends, to finally reach an agreement. 
In many fields indeed, texts have now been finalised. However, as the Commission President pointed out, the three major stumbling blocks related to the level playing field, to governance and fisheries remain, due to the British position. There are only 36 days left until the United Kingdom will have left the customs union and the single market, yet there is still no agreement and there’s still no text available. 
I want to point out that we cannot simply wait until the very last minute to agree on a text, since we as a Parliament have to scrutinise the final text, in the same way as we have been scrutinising the entire negotiation process. 
The United Kingdom will remain a close partner and ally of the European Union. For this reason we should use all our efforts to set the ground for fruitful cooperation beyond the end of the transition period. This will, colleagues, indeed require a certain degree of flexibility, creativity and pragmatism concerning our parliamentary procedures. 
But to be very clear, we as the European Parliament will have the last word. To give our consent we need to receive the text as soon as possible. Nobody should underestimate the risks that a late submission entails for the orderly start of our new EU—UK relations. Michel Barnier and his team are making the most of every opportunity to reach a deal in the interests of the European Union. On behalf of us all in the European Parliament, let me wish Michel Barnier good luck for the coming days, which certainly will be decisive.
(Applause)

Leider müssen wir uns heute einmal mehr hier im Plenum mit dem aggressiven Verhalten der Türkei befassen. Um es gleich zu Beginn deutlich zu betonen: Das türkische Vorgehen in Varosia ist nicht akzeptabel. Als Europäisches Parlament stehen wir an der Seite Zyperns und verurteilen nachdrücklich diese weitere unnötige Provokation durch Herrn Erdoğan.
Für uns in der Europäischen Union sind der Maßstab für die Zukunft Zyperns die einschlägigen Resolutionen des Sicherheitsrates der Vereinten Nationen. Es darf eben keine Aktivitäten geben, die nicht im Einklang mit diesen Resolutionen stehen. 
Die türkischen Pläne für Varosia werden die Aussicht auf eine Lösung des Zypernkonflikts ernsthaft untergraben; darauf haben viele Vorrednerinnen und Vorredner hingewiesen. Sie sind – aus meiner Sicht – nach den illegalen Bohrungen in griechischen und zypriotischen Gewässern, dem bilateralen Abkommen mit Libyen sowie der Eskalation in Bergkarabach und in Syrien eine weitere destabilisierende türkische Aktion. 
Der Hohe Vertreter Josep Borrell verdient weiterhin unsere Unterstützung, sich um Deeskalation in der Region zu bemühen. Eine Lösung aller strittigen Fragen kann nur im Dialog aller Beteiligten und auf Grundlage des Völkerrechts erreicht werden. Damit solche Gespräche aber stattfinden können, muss die Türkei endlich von einseitigen Provokationen absehen. Ansonsten bleiben für die Europäische Union weitere Sanktionen natürlich eine Option.
Statt durch permanente Konfrontation sollten unsere Beziehungen zur Türkei durch Dialog und Kooperation geprägt sein, aber dazu muss sich die türkische Politik endlich wesentlich ändern.

Of all territorial disputes of the post-Soviet states, this one is the most dangerous. As the European Parliament has repeatedly stated – and to be very clear once again – there is no, and there cannot be, a military solution to this conflict. Instead, a political settlement is necessary, in accordance with international law: for example, the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, the 1975 OSCE Helsinki Final Act, as well as the OSCE Minsk Group’s 2009 Basic Principles.
Therefore, we all call for an immediate halt to any military activity in the region. Both sides need to return to diplomatic dialogue without preconditions and in good faith. As many colleagues have already pointed out, third parties in the region should refrain from any action which can fuel the conflict and undermine the desire of the people from both countries for a peaceful future.

I would like to echo your justified words on the urgent need to ensure the preservation and the implementation of the JCPOA by all parties. This multilateral agreement, as we have underlined many times in this European Parliament, is a crucial achievement of European diplomacy. It remains a key pillar of the global non—proliferation architecture, contributing to regional security and stability and it addresses Iran’s nuclear programme in a comprehensive manner.
Colleagues, in 2018 the Foreign Affairs Committee visited Iran and Saudi Arabia. We had very interesting talks in Riyadh and Tehran and our key message was consistently a de—escalation in the region is a must. Today, more than two years later, this is more needed than ever before and that’s why, dear High Representative, I would like to underline what you announced as regards the snapback mechanism. All parties involved should do their utmost to preserve the JCPOA and to refrain from any action that could be perceived as an escalation in this current situation.

All of us are extremely concerned by the very real risk of a direct military confrontation. 
Last Thursday, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET), we discussed this dangerous escalation with the Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs for European Affairs of Greece and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey. It was a remarkable meeting in several aspects.
Listening to the comments of colleagues across party lines, for me four points are very clear. First, de—escalation is urgently needed. Second, we fully support the Council’s clear position of solidarity with our Member States, Greece and Cyprus. Third, we condemn the Turkish drilling activities in the exclusive economic zones of Greece and Cyprus, and we consider them illegal. Fourth, at the next European Council the option of additional sanctions against Turkey must be openly discussed in the light of continued Turkish aggression.
This conflict can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations. I very much hope that the ongoing mediation efforts will bear fruit. But, as the High Representative just underlined, further concrete steps towards creating an environment conducive to dialogue in good faith are needed now.

Secondly, that we don’t recognise the results of the presidential elections held in Belarus on 9 August as they were conducted in flagrant violation of all internationally recognised standards, and thirdly that we condemn the ongoing intimidation and disproportionate use of force towards peaceful protesters, participants of strikes and members of the Coordination Council.

Turkey must take concrete steps to de—escalate the current situation.

We all know that this pandemic will not only lead to more medical, social and economic changes of a tremendous dimension, but it will also, as the High Representative and Vice—President, Josep Borrell, has pointed out, also be a potential geopolitical game changer. To name just a few examples, we are witnessing the deterioration of democracy and fundamental freedoms in many parts of the world, increasing disinformation campaigns, as well as cyber—attacks and isolationism instead of multilateral cooperation. As the European Parliament, we should make clear that unprecedented global threats arising from the pandemic call for strong and coordinated measures. 
I welcome that, in the months and weeks to come, all the committees for external policies in our Parliament want to focus even more on our global response. With today’s debate, but also with upcoming hearings as well as the reports the respective committees are working on, hopefully we can highlight the importance of the foreign policy dimension for the fight against a global pandemic and we can send a strong signal of solidarity with our partners across the world.

From the very beginning, we in Parliament’s UK Coordination Group followed the negotiations for a new partnership thoroughly and sought to ensure a strong political consensus. We have closely been in touch with our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, whom I would like to thank personally for the excellent cooperation. I also would like to thank Maroš Šefčovič, and we will all be seeing each other again in about half an hour’s time for the next meeting of the UK Coordination Group.
This report incorporates the opinions of no less than 17 committees. This is unprecedented, and it delivers a clear and strong message of unity. That’s why I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Kati Piri and Christophe Hansen, for their tireless work, but also the Chairs and the rapporteurs of all the opinion-giving committees.
Yes, indeed, the high-level conference decided that new momentum is required for the negotiations. The EU is ready to intensify the talks in July to create the most conducive solutions for concluding an agreement soon. This should be in the interest of both sides.

This pandemic knows no borders; neither should the EU’s response. That is why the chairs of the committees in this Parliament who deal with external policies have issued a joint statement. We have called for close cooperation with our neighbours and partners, both in the fight against the pandemic as an imminent health issue and against its serious future consequences. 
In the past few weeks, we have seen remarkable efforts of cooperation and acts of goodwill, but we have also had to witness increased isolationism, harsh competition between nations for medicines and equipment, intense propaganda and disinformation by third countries, and a sharp rise in cyber—attacks. This shows this pandemic has a global meaning. It’s a global challenge. 
The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will be the main instrument to tackle this challenge we face within the European Union, but also to support our partners not only, but foremost, in our immediate neighbourhood. This has to be covered in the future MFF.

Die Europäische Union darf sich jedoch nicht unter Druck setzen lassen. Die flüchtenden Menschen dürfen kein Spielball geopolitischer Interessen sein. Entscheidend ist: Wir brauchen Humanität und Ordnung an der türkisch-griechischen Grenze. Derzeit fehlt es an beiden. Eine Situation wie 2015 darf sich nicht wiederholen. Das bedeutet vor allem eines: Keine unkontrollierte Migration nach Europa. Um Ordnung sicherzustellen, müssen wir für einen wirksamen Schutz der EU-Außengrenzen sorgen. Die Ereignisse der letzten Wochen haben gezeigt, dass die Europäische Union in ihrem Denken und Handeln sowie in ihrer Kommunikation nach außen stärker, geeinter und strategischer auftreten muss. Es ist höchste Zeit, dass die EU einen humanen, wirksamen und umfassenden Ansatz für die Migration findet.

As the Chair, I would like to thank all members of our group, as well as the involved Committees and the political groups, for their contributions in an extremely short period of time. In my opinion, the result is a very good and balanced resolution only nine days after Michel Barnier presented the Commission’s draft mandate.
Our resolution contains Parliament’s views on the content and on the architecture of a future EU-UK relationship. Let me highlight three main principles of particular importance.
Firstly, the integrity and the correct functioning of our internal market, the customs union and the Four Freedoms must be maintained. Secondly, a third country cannot have the same rights and benefits as a Member State of the EU. And thirdly, a level playing field is an overall priority and precondition for any future agreement. We should not, and we will not, enter a race to the bottom.
As Ursula von der Leyen has pointed out, together with our British friends, we should aim for a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope: everything from climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. We are indeed ready to design a new partnership with zero tariffs, zero quotas and zero dumping. However a free trade agreement with the UK will not be equivalent to frictionless trade.
Ladies and gentlemen, besides the negotiations on the future relations, the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement is of particular importance. This concerns especially citizens’ rights, financial duties on the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.
Our chief negotiator Michel Barnier, whose work is highly appreciated across party lines in the institutions, has already assured us in the UK coordination group’s first meeting to keep Parliament fully informed at all stages of the procedure.

However, this Withdrawal Agreement provides now for an orderly exit of the UK from our EU by addressing all issues that have been of key importance for us in the European Parliament from the onset of the negotiations. We must now focus on our common future relations. I believe the EU should enter these negotiations from a position of certainty, good will, respect and mutual interest. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that our partnership will remain close, but will no longer be the same. We need to negotiate a truly ambitious and comprehensive new partnership with the UK, but because of the limited timeframe for negotiations, we cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. We will have to prioritise, as Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has pointed out. 
I would like to thank all members of the Brexit Steering Group for the very good work they have done, and I hope to continue their good work in the UK Coordination Group, which I’m honoured to chair. More than 100 meetings of the Brexit Steering Group is an impressive track record. Let me thank our colleagues, staff and especially Mr Guy Verhofstadt for his excellent work.

David McALLISTER,2020-01-14,EN,Annual report on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy - Annual report on the implementation of the common security and defence policy (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-14-INT-2-373-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister,  Rapporteur. – Madam President, with this year’s annual report on the common foreign and security policy, I believe that we have once again identified the major issues our European Union is facing, and we also outline a possible way forward. The first two weeks of this new year have reminded us that the European Union’s security environment is today more volatile, more unpredictable, more complex and more ambiguous than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Let me underline the three main findings of my annual CFSP report. 
Firstly, multilateralism is at stake. In such challenging times, where multilateralism is increasingly called into question, we – as a European Union – must take a firm stand against this trend, putting multilateralism at the core of our efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts. In the current setting, the CFSP must effectively promote our interests and values in our neighbourhood and around the whole world. We should take advantage of the new political cycle of our institutions to build a stronger, more proactive and strategic European Union. 
Secondly, reinforcing the European Parliament as a pillar of the CFSP: during the past legislature, this European Parliament has played a prominent role in mediation in the peaceful resolution of protracted conflicts. Our efforts were successful, for instance, in Ukraine and in North Macedonia. These efforts, especially in the framework of the Jean Monnet Dialogue, should remain a priority in the upcoming years. We should also strengthen our role and oversight and scrutiny of the CFSP – but also, of course, of the EU external instruments. In this context, we must aim for a more strategic approach and greater coherence, consistency and complementarity between the external financial instruments and the common foreign and security policy. 
Thirdly, strengthening the CFSP to counter global threats: I am, for example, convinced that qualified majority voting would make the EU’s foreign and security policy more effective and speed up the decision—making process. The need for unanimity is keeping us from being able to act credibly on the global stage. On the EU’s common security and defence policy, we need to strengthen capacity on EU— and Member State—level to act autonomously, as well as to foster partnerships with regional organisations. The announcement by the Commission President to build a genuine and operational European defence union within the next five years is welcome. 
Finally, no single EU Member State can respond effectively to today’s global challenges on its own. We must continue to promote our European values whilst staying committed to a rules-based international order and economic cooperation. The European Union is a major player when it comes to diplomacy, trade, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and – step by step – also in the field of security and defence. Our European Union should act strategically by using its wide array of policies and instruments to respond to the challenges in our direct neighbourhood and beyond. The time has come, as the EU, to take our destiny into our own hands and embrace our role as a fully-fledged sovereign political and economic power in international relations, and I can only commend what the High Representative/Vice President has announced in the first weeks in office. I think he has a huge support here in the European Parliament. Finally, I would like to thank all our colleagues for their good contributions – especially, of course, the shadow rapporteurs – for a very good and fruitful cooperation.

Since we're running late, I would suggest that I keep it very short. I would just like to thank you all for your contributions. I would like to thank you for an honest and open debate. It was a pleasure for me to witness that a majority of speakers in this House is in favour of acting towards a stronger common foreign and security policy of our European Union. A lot of work lies ahead of us. I have, in particular, the ongoing negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework in mind in these upcoming negotiations. Dear Mr Borrell, we not only have to ensure the adequate financing but also the coherence, the effectiveness, the responsiveness and the flexibility of our external financing instruments. Let me also finally thank the High Representative – not only we are still here in the plenary but also he himself, for many, many hours now. I think this shows the respect that the High Representative is showing for the European Parliament.

Wir haben es gerade vom Hohen Vertreter gehört: In Libyen spielt sich ein politisches Drama ab, und zwar ein politisches und humanitäres Drama – direkt vor unserer Haustür. Dieses Drama hat viel zu lange viel zu wenig Beachtung gefunden. Die Zahlen der Vereinten Nationen sind bekannt: Seit Beginn der Offensive von General Haftar im April haben nach Angaben der UN über 1 100 Menschen ihr Leben verloren, es gibt über 340 000 Binnenvertriebene, und 900 000 Menschen sind auf humanitäre Hilfe angewiesen, davon zwei Drittel Frauen und Kinder. Die Not ist groß.
Ich finde, die seit Sonntag geltende Waffenruhe in Libyen ist ein Schritt nach vorne. Das Land und die Menschen brauchen jedoch – das haben wir gehört – einen dauerhaften Frieden. Die Bundesregierung und speziell die Bundeskanzlerin unterstützen seit geraumer Zeit Aktivitäten, einen dauerhaften Frieden in Libyen herzustellen. Und diese Konferenz, Herr Hoher Vertreter, die nach meinem Kenntnisstand am nächsten Sonntag in Berlin stattfinden wird, soll eben dazu einen aktiven Beitrag leisten.
Was wir auch als Vertreter eines Europäischen Parlaments klar sagen müssen, ist: Das ist nicht das erste Mal, dass wir diesen Konflikt debattieren. Alle Staaten, die an diesem Konflikt direkt oder indirekt beteiligt sind, müssen dafür sorgen, dass dieser Bürgerkrieg endlich beendet werden kann und Frieden in Libyen einkehren kann. Libyen soll künftig ein souveränes, ein friedliches Land sein. Erst wenn das gelingt, können wir über den Wiederaufbau konkret sprechen, und dann wird es auch eine besondere Aufgabe der Europäischen Union sein, Unterstützung zu geben.

Firstly, the practice of arbitrary detentions without any charge, trial or conviction for a criminal offence of Uyghur or other Muslim minorities must be ended immediately and the detained persons should be released unconditionally. Secondly, the authorities in Beijing should allow free and unhindered access to Xinjiang for journalists and international observers, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. And thirdly, the full details of persons disappeared in Xinjiang should be released and handed over to their families. In their joint statement issued after the 21st EU—China Summit, the EU and China reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, so it’s up to Beijing to put these words into action. I welcome, Mr High Representative/Vice—President, your clear words this afternoon, and I welcome the draft resolution we will adopt tomorrow noon – especially the call for targeted sanctions.

David McALLISTER,2019-12-16,DE,Macro-financial assistance to Jordan (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-16-INT-1-164-0000_DE.html,"  David McAllister,  im Namen der PPE-Fraktion. – Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar, meine sehr verehrten Damen, sehr geehrte Herren, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Gestatten Sie mir als Vorsitzendem des Ausschusses für auswärtige Angelegenheiten einige wenige Anmerkungen zu diesem Thema. Wir haben es eben gerade sowohl von der Berichterstatterin wie auch vom Herrn Kommissar gehört – Jordanien steht vor enormen Herausforderungen: Die Wachstumsrate sinkt, die Staatsverschuldung wird größer, und die Arbeitslosenquote insbesondere unter jungen Menschen steigt. Viele äußere Umstände haben zu dieser Entwicklung beigetragen. Als Nachbarland von Syrien und als Nachbarland von Irak ist Jordanien unmittelbar von den schrecklichen bewaffneten Konflikten in der Region betroffen. Laut jordanischen Angaben – Kommissar Gentiloni hat diese Zahl gerade eben bestätigt – befinden sich derzeit rund 1,3 Millionen – 1,3 Millionen! – Syrer in Jordanien. Trotz der enormen Belastung für Staat und Gesellschaft ist der Umgang des Landes mit dieser schwierigen Situation vorbildlich.
Deshalb ist es so wichtig, dass wir als Europäische Union dem Ersuchen Jordaniens um eine makrofinanzielle Hilfe in Höhe von 500 Millionen Euro geschlossen zustimmen. Ich werde selber am 4. und 5. Januar in Jordanien vor Ort sein. Herr Kommissar Gentiloni, ich kann Ihnen nur zustimmen, dass wir als Europäisches Parlament dem Vorschlag der Kommission folgen sollten, um unserem Partner und unserem Verbündeten Jordanien weiterhin unter die Arme greifen zu können.

David McALLISTER,2019-11-27,DE,Eastern neighbourhood developments (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-27-INT-3-225-0000_DE.html,"  David McAllister,  im Namen der PPE-Fraktion. – Herr Präsident, sehr verehrte Hohe Vertreterin und Vizepräsidentin, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren! Wir haben es gerade von der Hohen Vertreterin gehört: Die Östliche Partnerschaft ist ein wichtiges Instrument, um die Transformation von ehemals autoritären, sozialistischen Systemen hin zu demokratischen, rechtsstaatlichen und marktwirtschaftlichen Ländern zu fördern.
Aus meiner Sicht sind es drei Ziele, die die weitere Gestaltung der Östlichen Partnerschaft jetzt begleiten sollten: Erstens: Die Europäische Union sollte die politische und wirtschaftliche Integration der östlichen Partnerländer zu einer strategischen Priorität des nächsten Jahrzehnts machen. Das gilt insbesondere für die Ukraine, für Georgien und für Moldau, mit denen wir bereits vertiefte und umfassende Assoziierungsabkommen vereinbart haben.
Zweitens: Dieser Integrationsprozess erfordert von uns als EU eine klare, konsequente Strategie und aktive Unterstützung und – auf der anderen Seite – ernsthafte Bemühungen von unseren Partnern. Es gilt – und das haben wir oft betont in diesem Hohen Hause – der Grundsatz „mehr für mehr“, more for more, aber – daran darf eben auch kein Zweifel bestehen – auch der Grundsatz „weniger für weniger“, less for less. Und so, wie es die Hohe Vertreterin gerade erläutert hat, sollten wir uns bei den Anreizen für weitere Reformfortschritte konzentrieren auf die Bereiche Demokratie, Rechtsstaatlichkeit, unabhängige Justiz und Kampf gegen die Korruption.
Drittens: Um die Dynamik der Östlichen Nachbarschaft zu nutzen, ist es notwendig, dass die Europäische Union in der Tat weiter voranschreitet und einen qualitativ differenzierten Ansatz verfolgt. Einen Beitrag dazu könnte die von Andrius Kubilius – der hier im Plenum sitzt und gleich das Wort ergreifen wird – maßgeblich initiierte Trio-Strategie 2030 für die Beziehungen mit der Ukraine, mit Georgien und mit Moldau leisten.
Die Östliche Partnerschaft ist auch Teil einer langfristigen Strategie gegenüber Russland, denn die Erfolgsgeschichten der mit der EU assoziierten Länder können auch den Menschen in Russland Hoffnung geben, dass positive Veränderungen möglich sind. Diese Ziele sollten wir als Europäisches Parlament in enger Zusammenarbeit mit der heute neu gewählten Europäischen Kommission entschlossen vorantreiben. Und diese Ziele sollten rechtzeitig vor dem entsprechenden Gipfel im nächsten Jahr vorgelegt werden.
And finally, dear Federica, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, your committee in this European Parliament, let me say a word of thank you. Like nearly every Wednesday during plenary sessions in Strasbourg, you’re sitting on your seat discussing foreign policy with interested colleagues from all the political groups, wholeheartedly let me once again thank you for the excellent work you have done in the last five years. I’m saying that as a representative of the EPP to a socialist. We always had a wonderful cooperation. I wish you all the best for your future and hopefully we will come together at some other stage again. Thank you so much, Federica.

David McALLISTER,2019-11-13,EN,Turkish drilling activities in EU waters in the Eastern Mediterranean (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-13-INT-1-171-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Mr President, the European Union has repeatedly called on Ankara to cease its illegal activities in the eastern Mediterranean, but Turkey has continued its drilling operations within Cypriot international waters. Let’s be very clear, these activities are illegal under international law. They reflect the regrettable change of Turkish foreign policy and they have a negative impact on Turkey-EU relations. 
Madam High Representative, I welcome the adoption by the EU Foreign Affairs Council of a legal framework for possible sanctions against individuals and entities that are involved in the drilling activities, but as Mr Michael Gahler pointed out, now the names need to be added to the list. These sanctions are a necessary step to put pressure on Turkey to respect the sovereignty of Cyprus and therefore the integrity of our European Union territory.

David McALLISTER,2019-10-23,EN,The Turkish military operation in northeast Syria and its consequences (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-10-23-INT-3-032-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Madam President, the Turkish military operation in north—eastern Syria is yet another devastating event in an extremely tragic conflict. It has serious humanitarian, military and political repercussions, it causes suffering for the local people and it may contribute to a resurgence of Islamic terrorism. I would like to underline what colleagues, especially the group coordinators of the EPP, S&D and ALDE, have mentioned this morning.
I would like to inform you that this week in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) I published, together with the Chairs of the Foreign Affairs Committees of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and also the US House of Representatives, a joint statement on the Turkish invasion. In our letter, we consider the abandonment of the Syrian Kurds to be wrong as the Syrian Democratic Forces massively contributed to the successful yet unfinished fight against Daesh in Syria. We deeply regret the decision of the President of the United States to withdraw American troops from north-eastern Syria and we call upon the European Union and the Member States to take responsibility and engage in the conflict resolution.
In our draft resolution that will be voted tomorrow, we also call for a strong and comprehensive EU reaction to this ongoing crisis. A final remark – I welcome initiatives to establish an internationally controlled security zone in north-east Syria. Such a zone could stabilise the region and make sure that rebuilding civilian life is possible again.

Michel Barnier was referring to the political declaration and, yes, in the political declaration the EU and the UK have agreed on a broad future relationship with a free-trade area, police and judicial cooperation, and close cooperation on foreign policy, external security and defence. Following a no—deal Brexit, the United Kingdom could no longer collaborate in existing and future projects of the European Defence Agency or in military projects under Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). Moreover, it would be difficult for UK defence companies to participate in projects under the European Defence Fund.
These are additional arguments, dear colleagues from the far right, why it is so important to avoid a no-deal under all circumstances. I would like to welcome this motion for a resolution and I would like to thank our colleagues in the Brexit Steering Group for once again doing a great job.
(Applause)

David McALLISTER,2019-07-16,EN,Implementation of the EU Global Strategy (debate),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-07-16-INT-2-176-0000_EN.html,"  David McAllister (PPE).   – Mr President, three years later the five priorities the EU Global Strategy outlined in 2016 remain valid: the security of Europe itself; a stable neighbourhood; an integrated approach to conflicts; cooperative regional orders; and an effective global governance.
Like other speakers, in particular, I welcome the increased defence cooperation between the EU Member States and the steps taken to increase our military autonomy. Still, the overall implementation of the strategy leaves room for improvement undoubtedly, but for a stronger and more coherent common foreign and security policy, the EU must among other points firstly better combine policies and tools ranging from diplomacy, security and defence, to finance, trade development and human rights. Secondly, we need to strengthen the coherence, effectiveness and the flexibility of our external financing instruments. And thirdly, we need to move to qualified majority voting in specific areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
I’m thankful that the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen mentioned the latter point in her speech this morning, and I would like to thank Federica Mogherini for the good work she has done on this Global Strategy.

So I am more than happy, and let me admit, I am relieved that this country has finally begun turning from a captured state into a recovering democracy. Mr President, I think that the High Representative usually gets for floor first. I think the High Representative should perhaps give us an update first.

Throughout the last legislature, we held many debates on Moldova in this plenary, and not a single one was positive. So I am more than happy – yes, I am actually relieved – that this country has finally begun turning from a captured state into a recovering democracy.
This is a huge victory for all the Moldovans who voted for change. Now the new Prime Minister, Ms Maia Sandu, has to tackle a number of challenges. Federica Mogherini just mentioned a number of them: the fight against corruption, the reform of the judiciary, the depoliticisation of the state administration, the electoral reform and a pluralistic media landscape with adequate financing and safeguards to protect journalists. 
A sustainable reform agenda for Moldova should be accompanied by a determined effort to heal the deep social divisions that we have seen in recent months, including a genuine commitment to inter-party dialogue in the Parliament in Chișinău. We will be welcoming Prime Minister Sandu in the Foreign Affairs Committee next Wednesday on 24 July. We will look forward to continuing the debate with her on that occasion.
