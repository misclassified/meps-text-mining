She highlighted the need for a concrete and realistic approach to addressing economic and energy challenges faced by women and families in Europe, rather than promoting gender ideology. Rossi criticized the report for constantly emphasizing a gender perspective and proposing the appointment of a European coordinator for gender, which she believes would only increase European bureaucracy without effectively solving the energy problem. She also raised objections to supranational interventionism in real estate markets and public housing, citing ideological elements that prevent her from supporting the report. Overall, Rossi's speeches indicate her focus on practical solutions to economic and energy challenges, while rejecting the promotion of gender ideology and unnecessary bureaucratic measures."], "final_summary": "The European Member of Parliament, Maria Veronica Rossi, from the ID Group, expressed concerns about a report that focuses on the energy crisis and inflation.
