It is obvious, but it cannot be limited to this the geopolitical interest of Europe for a fundamental partner Tunisia to control for example the migratory flows that in recent months have brought only 50 thousand illegal immigrants to Italy or the Sicily Canal from which much of the world's maritime trade passes. It is precisely this decommitment of the EU in foreign policy that has allowed foreign powers to steal us the role of privileged partner with Mediterranean countries, to put their hands on energy resources, trade routes and migration routes, to put us under blackmail. So it has happened in Libya, so it risks happening in Tunisia if the EU continues to sit in a corner to act as impotent voyeur.We cannot allow Tunisia as Libya to end up under the influence of hostile powers today and the only way to do so is to give priority to the involvement of these countries in a shared geopolitical agenda, otherwise our southern border will be overwhelmed by chaos and the Mediterranean, the cradle of European civilization, will turn into our grave.\\n\\nVincenzo Sofo (ECR). - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the need to set up a new European Agency for Health Strategy certifies the resounding failure of the EU's COVID management. On the other hand, the ECDC's inability to tackle the pandemic, the shameful censorship of vaccine contracts, the unjustified increase in their prices and the continuous changes in EMA's idea of their authorisation are clear proof of the total inadequacy and opacity of the policies adopted. Let it be clear: finally, to define a European health strategy that puts an end to dependence on the USA and Asia and that makes us sovereign in the protection of the health of our peoples is absolutely necessary, but it is disturbing that, despite the scandals just mentioned, the Commission has decided to deny this Parliament once again the control of the funds that will be allocated to public and private companies.A choice that smells so much of yet another favor to the lobbyists that, thanks to secret agreements with the EU, they have already earned tens and tens of billions of euros from the COVID with huge profit margins to the detriment of the portfolios of the citizens. Legitimate question therefore whether your goal is to put the Big Pharmas at the service of the people's health or better the health of the people at the service of the Big Pharmas.\\n\\nVincenzo Sofo (ECR). - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the need to set up a new European Agency for Health Strategy certifies the resounding failure of the EU's COVID management.

I will avoid talking about the blatant exploitation of a serious issue such as the involvement of women in the STEM professions to make trade marks for feminist lobbyists, immigrants and LGBT. One thing, however, you have to make clear to me: if you say that you need pink quotas to favour women over men, you admit that there are women and men, but at the same time, if you sponsor the gender LGBT theses, you say that being a woman is just our choice. So, applying your theories, if I say to you tomorrow that I automatically feel a woman I get the right to return to a pink quota.Not to mention transgender, all gender, pangender and the thousand other identities invented. Will you propose an ad hoc quota for each one of them?\", start_char_idx=2289897, end_char_idx=2294804, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7712160406017735),\n",

Long live Tunisian democracy!\\n\\nFabio Massimo Castaldo (NI). - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, increasing political, economic and trade relations with Taiwan is today a strategic priority for our Union, as well as a key step towards establishing ourselves as a leading player in the global chessboard, through strong agreements and links with partners who share our principles and values. I would like to insist on this very point. Taiwan, in fact, represents a bulwark of democracy and freedom in the Indo-Pacific area, a region in which authoritarian drives and aggressive impulses are becoming increasingly strong and evident, not only at dialectical level, but also through the use of increasing military exercises and direct interference in the political life of individual countries.Therefore, I believe it is essential that our Parliament and the Union as a whole should be active as of now all the political and diplomatic channels they have in place so that any negotiations between Taiwan and other regional actors can be conducted peacefully, avoiding the bullying of the threat of the use of arms. Similarly, the EU must ensure that Taipei can finally be admitted to all multilateral forums, particularly in the WHO, pushing for the anachronistic and unjustified political vetoes that stand in the way of inclusion to be overcome. Confucius reminds us that the wise man prefers to be slow to speak but ready to act; a council that we should absolutely make and assess as very valuable.\\n\\nFabio Massimo Castaldo (NI). - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, increasing political, economic and trade relations with Taiwan is today a strategic priority for our Union, as well as a key step towards establishing ourselves as a leading player in the global chessboard, through strong agreements and links with partners who share our principles and values.

The democratic transition of the country, which I have experienced closely as an electoral observer for the local elections, today is undergoing a heavy setback and Tunisia is in fact regressing already since July 2021, when the President frozen the parliament and began a path of repression against political opponents, trade unions and activists.The controversial constitutional referendum last July saw a turnout of 27 percent and the recent parliamentary elections, boycotted by mass, of only 11 percent. The scenario is therefore that of a man only in command, with full powers, and an extremely delegitimized parliament. The situation is unsustainable. As the European Parliament we immediately call for economic reforms for the country to obtain the necessary loans and a change of pace on the defence of the rule of law. The Tunisian people, to whom the European Union has always stood alongside in its democratic ambitions, undoubtedly deserve better conditions. Europe must not turn to the other side.\\n\\nBrando Benifei (S&D). - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Parliament to take action, and we must consider the proposals on the table and ask for them to be finally implemented, but we must not be a bad consigliere. We will be as demanding and ambitious as possible in making our institutions more transparent and impervious to corruption, together with measures to be implemented immediately and to be monitored. We also want deep structural reforms, the results of which will only be visible in the medium term. I am thinking of the new independent ethical body, which, as Socialists and Democrats, we have always asked together with other political groups, but which some other groups have always hindered.President Metsola's proposals are a good step forward, but they are still not enough, first of all, to address the issue of revolving doors, for which a cooling period is necessary, five years later; today only six months are proposed, too few, especially compared to the twenty-four months currently in force for the European Commissioners; we must produce a balanced result, not affecting the freedom of mandate of Members, the key principle of democracy, but having the certainty of radically avoiding any attempt at pollution and manipulation of our democratic bodies.\\n\\nBrando Benifei (S&D). - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Parliament to take action, and we must consider the proposals on the table and ask for them to be finally implemented, but we must not be a bad consigliere.
