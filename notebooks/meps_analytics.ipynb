Among our primary purposes as a democratic, peaceful, and safe Union, it is the duty to prevent and end wars, bring countries together, find diplomatic solutions, and save lives. The EU has to be ready to sustain Syrian citizens by directing its reconstruction funds to the rebuilding of the country, to ensure a safe return home for refugees, to relocate the missing, and finally pursuing punishment for the many war crimes against humanity.\\n\\n16, Andrea COZZOLINO, 2021-02-10, EN, The state of play of the EU’s COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-02-10-INT-3-149-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Andrea Cozzolino (S&D),  in writing. – I am sincerely concerned by the recent reports of delivery delays and dose reductions compared to the forecast for the first quarter of 2021, regarding producers BioNTech-Pfizer and AstraZeneca. I believe that these delays seriously undermine the Union and Member States vaccination plans’ objectives and the total effectiveness of the European COVID-19 vaccine strategy and the Union’s exit from the health emergency, including in terms of recovery economic. As done for the introduction of generic drugs for HIV at affordable prices 20 years ago, and the distribution of another vaccine during the polio epidemic in the 1950s, to guarantee widespread and equitable access to vaccines on a global scale, I ask the European Union: to evaluate to support the adoption of a moratorium that allows the suspension of patents and the sharing of technology, data, know-how, allowing generics manufacturers to contribute to increasing global availability, including through support for India and South Africa’s proposal at the WTO; to evaluate, as a member of the WTO, subject to an appropriate legislative act, the granting of a compulsory license for the production of covid-19 vaccines to public agencies or a generic drug manufacturer, according to TRIPS and the Doha Declaration.\\n\\n39, Dino GIARRUSSO, 2021-12-14, EN, Outcome of Global Summit Nutrition for Growth (Japan, 7-8 December) and increased food insecurity in developing countries (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-14-INT-2-303-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Dino Giarrusso (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, the Nutrition World Summit held in Japan last week was a crucial moment to discuss the future of food and nutrition at a global level. We all know nowadays how important nutrition is, but also how present is the malnutrition issue. For this reason we, as the EU, must commit on a three-strategy focus: health, food and resilience. 149\\xa0million children under five are stunted, 49 million are under weight, but another 40 million suffer obesity. \\nThe EU must stand as leader for nutrition in all terms – know-how, sustainable and healthy consumption of resources, promotion of European diets such as the Mediterranean one – the Italian one – as good practices, and also an efficient programme directed at those areas where children don’t have access to food.\\nWe have an ambitious goal now. No more children dead. No more disease by malnutrition. No more waste of food. In 2021 it’s time to act, and not to talk anymore.\\n\\n41, Dino GIARRUSSO, 2021-11-10, EN, One-minute speeches on matters of political importance, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-10-INT-1-239-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Dino Giarrusso (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, the flooding that has hit Sicily in the past weeks apparently will be a common phenomenon in the future. We have been talking about the rise of one or one and a half degrees on the planet for years, and I think was not enough to convince the people about the real issue of climate change. But now, with a temperature higher than the seasonal average, a more evident phenomenon is waking up the conscience. The fury of the wind is more even than some degrees more for a human being. That’s why we must act and take a decision now to avoid the first Mediterranean hurricane, which will be also the last. I am very close to my island. I hope the Solidarity Fund will be activated.\\nLa Sicilia si rialzerà e dobbiamo aiutarla, perché è una perla della nostra Europa!\\n\\n3, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-11-22, EN, 30 years of Copenhagen criteria - giving further impetus to EU enlargement policy (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-22-INT-3-309-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, 30 years have passed since we set out our criteria for accession. And after an initial impetus that brought us to the current 27 members, we started recording an enlargement fatigue that need to be left apart.\\nThe Russian criminal war against Ukraine, as well the other war crimes committed in our neighbourhood, most notably by Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, are making enlargement a first-class priority. But empty promises are no longer enough: we must push not only for Western Balkans, Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine, but also for a concrete action plan for the access of Armenia. And the first step will be to grant Yerevan the candidate status as soon as the official request is made.\\nNational political leaders must leave apart the short-sighted will to maximise internal consensus by obstructing the enlargement process, they must embrace a truly strategic vision and move further in the accession process for our future members before they will lose hope, starting from the most aligned to our foreign policy.\\nWidening and deepening are two rails of the same track. Our European project will never be completed until all the European countries that share our democratic values are part of the family. Let us move towards this direction now.\\n\\n5, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-11-21, EN, Question Time with Commissioners - The state of implementation of the EU’s commitment to provide 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition to Ukraine until March 2024, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-21-INT-2-414-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for being here today for discussing a very urgent matter, such as the capacity to provide Ukraine with the ammunition it needs to defend itself. I believe it is paramount that we keep up with our promises, also in light of the fact that other countries, such as North Korea, have already supported the replenishment of the Russian stockpiles consistently.\\nAt the same time, the possibility to achieve our goal came under question, as we have only provided 30% of the pledges. While it is true that our production capacity has increased by around 30% in the latest month, there is still a gap to close. Some analysts pointed out that one of the main problems is linked to the difficulties encountered by defence industries in accessing credit from European banks, since their products have been declared unsustainable by the European taxonomy.\\nWhile, on the one hand, we are equipping ourselves with complementary funds for the scale-up of defence-related production, with EDIRPA and ASAP, on the other, we are somehow obstructing the production cycle of these products. How can we combine the need for more sustainable economic and production models with the one of reinforcing our defence capabilities?\\n\\n15, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-10-03, EN, Question Time with Commissioners – EU-China trade relations, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-03-INT-2-303-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Commissioner, thank you for being here today with us for discussing a matter of pivotal importance such as the future of our trade relationship with China, a country that we see as a partner in the fight against global challenges, an economic competitor and also a systemic rival. \\nLast week you spoke at Tsinghua University and you rightfully insisted on the concept of reciprocity. Also, in light of the fact that our trade relations with China are becoming more and more unbalanced, how can we reverse this trend? Is there any action plan for reducing this trade gap? What about critical technologies and rare earths? These are two fields in China has a remarkable advantage at the global level.\\nFurthermore, as stated by the President Ursula von der Leyen during the State of the Union, the Commission will launch an investigation over Chinese state subsidies in the production of electric vehicles. I believe that the result of the investigation will be pretty clear and straightforward. Therefore, I would like to ask you whether you are already working on a plan to counter these distortions of the market. \\n\\n16, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-10-03, EN, Question Time with Commissioners – EU-China trade relations, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-03-INT-2-305-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Thank you, dear Commissioner, for your answers. I would like to go a bit further in detail into some considerations on the recent Chinese ban on the export of gallium and germanium metals and all final products that contain these elements. Two months after this ban, what is your evaluation on the effects it had on the market? Also, do you believe that it has negatively impacted our capacity to acquire products that contain these minerals?\\nLooking at the future, what is the way ahead for coping with these limitations, considering the fact that China has a stronghold over the global production of gallium and germanium? Do we have credible alternatives?\\n\\n18, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-10-03, EN, Recent developments in the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue, including the situation in the northern municipalities in Kosovo (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-03-INT-2-447-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, dear colleagues, reconciliation between Serbia and Kosovo is far from being just a regional issue. It is a strategic imperative for the whole of Europe. The recent failure in advancing this process is yet another obstacle on our way. But we must remain firm in saying that the future of Western Balkans lies in our Union. This, of course, cannot remain just a slogan. We must insist on the 11-point plan presented last February. But it will be pivotal to give more concreteness to the provisions included therein. Only by setting a clear roadmap for the implementation and setting concrete incentives can we make sure that both parties stick to the promises they made. Then it will come to the parties to leave aside the long-lasting issues and focus on a common future.\\nTherefore, I appeal once more to the leadership in Belgrade and Pristina to de-escalate immediately the tensions in northern Kosovo. We are here supporting you. Let us work together with a proactive and constructive approach towards a shared goal to meet your peoples’ aspiration for a peaceful, stable and prosperous future within our common European family. Violence is not the answer. It is just the past.\\n\\n19, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-09-13, EN, State of the Union (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-13-INT-3-088-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you for your clarity and courage today. You are right: history is calling for a geopolitical union to diligently protect our companies and workers from deceptive trade practices, subsidies and dumping employed by China. None of our Member States has the size, the strength nor the authority to safeguard our technological and industrial sovereignty in isolation. What has happened in recent years demonstrated this conclusively. Selling to public opinion the opposite at this juncture is much more than recklessly naive.\\nSimilarly, failing to publicly and unequivocally condemn the intolerable crimes against humanity perpetrated by Russia against the Ukrainian people is an act of profound hypocrisy. No pursuit of fleeting, easy electoral consensus can justify immoral silences and ambiguities. Our duty extends far beyond the next election. It encompasses the well-being of future generations of Europeans – a commitment I will continue to uphold no matter the risks.\\nYes, we must combine enlargement with political deepening. Yes, we must create an adequate budget financed by permanent common debt to protect our European common good. And yes, we must implement the necessary Treaty changes and launch a real European bottom up ...\\n(The President cut off the speaker)\\n\\n20, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-09-13, EN, The case of Dr Gubad Ibadoghlu, imprisoned in Azerbaijan, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-13-INT-3-379-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, the illegal detention of Dr Ibadoghlu is yet another example of the continuous crackdown on the rule of law and the violation of human rights perpetrated by the authorities in Baku, both domestically and at the regional level. Inside the country no dissident is allowed. According to Human Rights Watch, in 2022 more than 30 people remained wrongfully imprisoned. NGOs are prevented from working independently and systemic torture and ill treatment in custody, as well as restrictions on media freedoms, are the alarming normality.\\nWhat is happening at the regional level is in front of our eyes. The hateful blockade of the Lachin corridor seriously jeopardised the lives of 120\\xa0000 ethnic Armenians, and the recent self-proclaimed willingness to reopen the corridor is nothing more than another attempt to absorb the region completely with the risk of a full-scale ethnic cleansing.\\nDear colleagues, I have recently prepared a written question on the case of Dr Ibadoghlu and a letter on the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. We have to show that the brutal behaviour of the Baku regime will not be tolerated. We have to show that this Parliament must stand firmly in support of the Azeri civil society and in asking for the release of all the political prisoners. The smell of gas and oil shall not cover the scent of freedom.\\n\\n25, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-07-11, EN, Question Time (Commission) – EU-Africa Strategy, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-11-INT-2-340-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam Commissioner, thank you for being here today with us. As rightfully stated in the final declaration of the EU—African Union summit of February 2022, we do share with our African counterparts a series of common challenges that need to be addressed in a cooperative way. Further than that, in the EP recommendation for the Strategic Partnership with the Horn of Africa, for which I served as the rapporteur, we have stressed the need to reinforce this cooperation, leaving apart the obsolete donor recipient mentality and unleashing all its potential, basing our relation on timely, effective talks aimed at finding common ground.\\nOne area in which it seems to be difficult to keep the same speed and agree on certain commitments is the one of energy transition. Therefore I would like to ask you to elaborate on key messages and expectations conveyed by our African counterparts in terms of their perspectives on transition paths. For example, what is the pace of it, and the means of financing it? Where do they expect us to contribute the most? Thank you very much, and I will be eager to listen to your reply.\\n\\n26, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-07-11, EN, Question Time (Commission) – EU-Africa Strategy, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-11-INT-2-342-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Dear Commissioner, thank you for the all the details. I would like to ask you something related to the domain in this case of peace and security. When we presented the European Peace Facility, we stated that this would have increased our readiness to support efforts from our partners, as well as the predictability of our actions.\\nNow that the EPF funds have been completely devoted to the much-needed support to Ukraine, how can we support our African counterparts? And is there any plan to devote specific funding to this end?\\n\\n27, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-07-11, EN, Relations with the Palestinian Authority (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-11-INT-2-376-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Evin Incir, for the excellent recommendation that correctly reaffirms our commitment to a two-state solution, calls for an immediate cessation of violence, and stresses the importance of organising free and fair elections in Palestine.\\nCountless Palestinian and Israeli lives are lost every day. While recognising the legitimate security concerns of Israel about terrorism, we cannot ignore that the expansion of illegal settlements, as well as the destructions and the civilian victims provoked by the Israeli government’s military operations, not only pose a significant obstacle to the realisation of a two-state solution, but also tragically contribute to a growing rejection from the Palestinian people of a moderate leadership.\\nTherefore we must support and facilitate effective cooperation with the Palestinian Authority to build up democratic institutions. But we must also foster our cooperation with that part of the Israeli civil society that is clearly standing against all abuses and calling for the rejection of the hardliners’ long-term plan: building a state for the settlers in place of the Palestinian State, as the UN’s permanent observer said.\\nDear colleagues, we must not lose sight of our shared goals: a future where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace, security and mutual respect. Therefore I call on each of you to support this recommendation, sending them a message of hope and determination.\\n\\n28, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-07-11, EN, 2022 Report on Bosnia and Herzegovina (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-11-INT-2-413-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, it is often said that the decision to speed up the concession of the candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina is rooted in the changed geopolitical environment, especially the Russian war against Ukraine. This, in my opinion, is a sad reality. We cannot continue to treat the Western Balkans as a geopolitical problem that requires our reaction to external inputs. The potential increase of influence from third actors is certainly a growing danger that we should take into account, but we need also to take a lead and that cannot be our sole guiding light.\\nIt is also necessary to start to be coherent with our values. We have to sanction, finally, the secessionist actions of Dodik that is freezing and jeopardising the functioning of the state and is also undermining all chances of constitutional major reforms in the country. We must adopt, therefore, a proactive approach, leaving apart the tactical manoeuvres that in the past certain Member States have used so far to slow down the enlargement and to not take measures. Let us defend the perspective towards the European future for the Bosnians, let us realise that the Western Balkans are future members of our Union and not simple partners that we should convince to stay on our side. Otherwise we will simply continue to react to threats and at a certain point it will be simply too late. \\n\\n29, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-07-11, EN, 2022 Report on Albania (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-11-INT-2-439-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, in 2022, after regrettable delays, we finally have reached a significant milestone with the official start of the accession talks and acknowledgment of the remarkable progress Albania has made in advancing the EU reform agenda. Tirana has consistently demonstrated unwavering commitment to EU integration, both in the political and the public domain. I commend the report for acknowledging this dedication, while also highlighting areas that require further attention and efforts, particularly the fight against corruption and media freedom. \\nDear colleagues, recent events, especially the criminal aggression in Ukraine, have emphasised once again an obvious truth – strength lies in unity. Now more than ever, the completion of the EU enlargement in the Western Balkans has become a strategic priority for the future of our Union. \\nIt is not by chance that the candidate countries, including Albania, have been particularly targeted by Russian disinformation and hybrid attacks. We have demonstrated in practice, and not just in words, our resolute commitment to enlargement, avoiding further factious delays that undermine our credibility and frustrate our partners. \\nAlthough significant work remains to be done, Albania is undoubtedly on the right track. I urge them to keep delivering on the necessary reforms foreseen and our Union, especially the Member States, to recognise and reward their efforts in the critical years of negotiation ahead.\\n\\n31, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-06-13, EN, Question Time (VPC/HR) - Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and at the Lachin Corridor, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-249-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, dear High-Representative Borrell, first of all, I would like to thank you for being here today with us for discussing once again the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan. \\nDespite the fact that the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and especially in the Lachin corridor continue to cause concern due to the volatility of the security environment, I strongly believe that it is now time to devote all our attention to the relationship between the two capitals. \\nIndeed, we are now seeing a window of opportunity for a comprehensive peace agreement, and I do believe that it is essential that our Union plays a major role in this phase, not only by brokering the negotiations, but also in what concerns the guarantees that the Armenian side rightfully demands. \\nTalking about the negotiations, what role we can play in ensuring that the potential peace deal is truly acceptable by both sides, thus avoiding a recrudescence of hostilities in the future? What we can do to facilitate the return of the war prisoners held by Baku, actually isolated from their families? And on the practical side, what can be our contribution to the international mechanism for guaranteeing the security of the Armenian population residing in Nagorno-Karabakh? Do you see any involvement and subsequent reinforcement of our CSDP mission on the ground? \\n\\n32, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-06-13, EN, Question Time (VPC/HR) - Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and at the Lachin Corridor, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-251-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Yes, thank you, Chair. Our representative, following on from your suggestion, I wanted to ask you one of the key issues that I think could be very important for the peace process, the mining, the demilitarised zones. If a mutually acceptable internationally guaranteed peace agreement is to be reached, we must make sure that all the areas affected by hostilities are made safe for the civilians. Our Union and the Member States have a consistent experience with mining and, thus, I was wondering if we already have offered our full support to this end and if this can be done through a proper CSDP mission really focused on de-mining or agreed bilaterally on an ad hoc basis? \\n\\n35, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-05-09, EN, Situation in Sudan (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-09-INT-2-320-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, once again, we are witnessing what could turn out to be another humanitarian catastrophe, and it is paramount to use all our means to prevent it.\\nHowever, we cannot limit ourselves to the provisions of immediate humanitarian aid. This time, it is imperative to accompany our actions with a thorough reflection on our approach to foreign policy. In my recommendation on a strategic partnership with the Horn of Africa and Eastern Africa, approved last October, this House pointed out the absolute need to establish a thorough engagement with our counterparts based on the preventive and substantial dialogue aiming at understanding the needs and working together towards the solutions.\\nI have the feeling that this has not happened in Sudan as the long-lasting problems that persist since the coup that overthrown al-Bashir are at the core of the current disaster. We welcome the talks for a democratic transition, full of wishful thinking, as it should be, but we must understand that hoping for the best is not sufficient. If we do not engage constructively and in a timely, effective manner, we will always need to run for cover when it is already too late and this is something that cannot be accepted anymore.\\n\\n36, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-05-09, EN, 2022 Report on Kosovo (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-09-INT-2-372-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, we must be explicit. To move forward on their European path, it is essential for both Kosovo and Serbia to abandon provocative language and hostile actions, leaving space for concrete efforts to reach mutually acceptable and negotiated solutions.\\nThe road towards EU integration will require difficult decisions and compromises, and it is crucial for both Belgrade and Pristina to start thinking in the long term and focus on the larger goal of a European future. Our contribution to these efforts is clear. We must be firm in our commitments and continue to do our best to prove the clear benefits of EU membership. To do so, I believe it is essential to reinforce and to find synergies of action between the EU initiatives for the region and the other bi or multilateral fora.\\nAnd I would like to thank the colleagues and the rapporteur that supported my amendment in both reports in the committee. Therefore, colleagues, I urge you to support the excellent job of the rapporteur in this report to recognise the progress made and to encourage both Pristina and Belgrade to continue their efforts towards finding solutions that will ensure a stable, prosperous European future for their citizens because they are the future members of our European family.\\n\\n37, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-04-18, EN, The need for a coherent strategy for EU-China Relations (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-04-18-INT-2-017-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, Madam President, High Representative, dear colleagues, it is certainly true that we are obliged to pursue a selective engagement with Beijing on those dossiers that are multilateral by nature, most notably the fight against climate change. But we cannot overlook those unacceptable behaviours that the Chinese Government refuses to leave apart.\\nSeveral colleagues in this room are still under sanctions. And last Friday, we have seen the unbelievable arrests of human rights activists that were going to a meeting with our delegation in Beijing. Furthermore, the so-called military exercises near Taiwan are dangerously similar to a fully-fledged invasion. And China’s neutrality regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine is – quoting our High Representative – simply just not credible.\\nIn diplomacy and in geopolitics, it takes two to tango. Nothing more than a mere selective engagement on certain issues can be accepted before we see real and effective actions from our Chinese counterparts in those fields that are not only essential to us, but universal by definition, such as human rights. Let’s keep the channel for dialogue open, but without being naive, therefore protecting our strategic infrastructure and our European technological sovereignty. And let’s always speak with one single voice to defend our red lines for real.\\n\\n41, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-03-14, EN, Deterioration of democracy in Israel and consequences on the occupied territories (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-14-INT-2-333-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, the recent developments have shown a global alarming trend towards the normalisation of far—right and ultra—nationalist ideologies, with the potential to further erode the democratic principles on which the EU and the EU partnership are founded.\\nIsrael makes no exception. As it is well known, the Pegasus spyware developed and distributed by an Israeli company is being widely used to target human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents across the world, including in our Union. This is an aspect that should be firmly taken into account in all our cooperation, especially when they are set up, and as it happened with the Israeli police force, including on cybercrimes, to ensure adequate controls and conditionalities, because the use of such spyware to silence dissidents and stifle free speech is a threat to democracy and must be firmly condemned.\\nAs representatives of the European Union we must use our voice to call for greater accountability and transparency in the sale and the use of such technology. We must stand in solidarity with those who fight for human rights and democratic values, because only by working together can we ensure a future where all people can live in freedom, dignity and justice.\\n\\n44, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-02-15, EN, European Central Bank - annual report 2022 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-15-INT-3-273-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, President Lagarde, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, you may not be allowed to admit it, yet deflation has started.\\nGiven that large part of the sky-high record inflation that was steeply driven that started arising after the end of the sanitary measures and eventually exacerbated by the war in Ukraine; given that energy prices have come down significantly, we are really concerned about further raises of ECB interest rates to cut demand and consumption in order to lower inflation. It just doesn’t seem the right way to achieve it.\\nWe need to address the root causes of inflation, tailoring the solution to the issue, which is mainly energy-related. I want to remind to all of us that, in this particular situation, it is up to the co-legislators to act, to continue with our efforts to diversify our energy sources and reduce energy consumption. I am afraid that keeping rising interest rates would only have a harsher impact on entrepreneurs and households, who we must defend – and I reiterate, defend – not threaten. \\n\\n45, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-02-14, EN, Establishment of an independent EU Ethics Body (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-14-INT-2-330-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the creation of an independent EU ethics body is a crucial first step in restoring public trust in the European Union after the Qatargate scandal. \\nHowever, given its nature of interinstitutional agreement, with the timelines needed for such an act, there is an important necessity to use all our means to prevent such cases of corruption or misconduct from being repeated. \\nPresident Metsola’s package is a good start but we can and we must do more. I am thinking, for example, about the need to clearly define conflict of interest and strictly regulate the phenomenon of the revolving doors to ensure transparency on the decision-making for our Parliament in the Bureau as well as in the CoP. \\nThere is an issue that I believe we must immediately fix to build a more democratic and accountable Europe. In 2019, the EU finally adopted a dedicated and comprehensive directive on whistle-blower protection, which does not include the staff members of the EU institutions, agencies and bodies. Speaking up is one of the hardest acts a person can do. It requires immense courage and sacrifice. We must encourage our whistle-blowers and we must protect them in the moment in which they will denounce.\\n\\n46, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-02-14, EN, Response to the situation in Tunisia (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-14-INT-2-398-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, in our latest discussion on the situation on Tunisia, we sent a very clear appeal to President Saied for bringing back Tunisia on the right path, saying that it was not too late for taking such an essential step. However, this is time, I think, that it is too late. Despite the civil protests and our calls, President Saied went on with these arbitrary detentions and he did not show any sign of consideration for the recent decision of the African Court on Human and Peoples\\' Rights that defined his rise to power as an unconstitutional coup against democracy. Being a founding member of the African Court, Tunisia has a binding obligation to respect the verdict, thus repealing all those decrees that represent clear violations of human rights and individual liberties, President Saied, cannot act as if nothing happened. And our union must strongly support and back our African counterparts and partners in their efforts to restore democracy and the rule of law in the country that used to be the lighthouse of democracy in North Africa. \\nWe owe this to the Tunisian people that fought hard for a better future. Here there is no middle ground: either we stand firmly on the side of democracy or our international credibility will be lost forever. \\n\\n47, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-02-01, EN, Situation in Afghanistan (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-01-INT-1-164-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear Commissioner, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, 55% of the Afghan population is in dire need of humanitarian assistance. And numbers are set to rise due to the winterisation of the crisis.\\nThe decision to ban women from working in the public sector is not only unacceptable in itself, but it also constitutes a crime against humanity as it directly hampers the delivery of the humanitarian aids. Therefore, apart from expanding our individual sanctions to the Taliban leadership, we should also submit a formal request to the International Criminal Court to investigate and prosecute those responsible.\\nNevertheless, we ask you, Madam Commissioner, to encourage and support the United Nations and engage NGOs to find workarounds that can prevent the halt of the humanitarian assistance.\\nDear colleagues, we cannot look the other way while children, women and men, to which we promised a better future, are starving and do not have access to medicines. While we strongly and unwaveringly condemn the abhorrent policies put in place by the Taliban regime, we must do all we can for avoiding that Afghanistan becomes the hell on earth.\\n\\n49, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-01-18, EN, Humanitarian consequences of the blockade in Nagorno-Karabakh, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-01-18-INT-3-411-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, in Nagorno—Karabakh, the guns are currently silent, yet the war is far from being over. \\nIndeed, after the previous criminal attack to Armenia, we are now seeing one of the worst sides of the war, with a hateful blockade since 30 days of the Lachin corridor from fake Azeri eco—activists that are putting the lives of thousands of people, of children, of women and fragile persons at risk, not due to bombings or gunshots but to starvation and hindered access to medicines. We must seriously step up our force for stopping these atrocities.\\nFirst, our monitoring mission should have the mandate to enter the Lachin corridor immediately to verify what is happening on the ground. Yerevan has already granted access to its territories, and we demand Baku do the same without any further delay. Then we must be proactive in ensuring that the affected population receives the necessary humanitarian supplies, organising immediate relief to the region.\\nIf the Baku regime denies access, we have to stand ready for adopting a set of adequate, strong sanctions targeting those responsible for these atrocities. Dear colleagues, in this context, any attempt to undermine access to food amounts to a war crime. We have loudly denounced that in Ukraine, and we must reaffirm that in the same way in Nagorno—Karabakh. When the lives of people are at risk, there is no space, not even a single inch, for double standards.\\n\\n51, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2023-01-17, EN, The establishment of a tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-01-17-INT-2-435-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, the Russian cruise missile attack on Dnipro on Saturday afternoon was described as a hell on earth by those who were lucky enough to survive and witness the aftermath. In mere seconds, a building was transformed into a pile of rubble, resulting in 40 deaths, 75 injuries, and many missing. My thoughts and solidarity go out to the survivors, their families and the Ukrainian people.\\nIn light of these horrible and unforgivable crimes, it is even worse to consider the possibility that those responsible could go unpunished. The silver lining is that we already have the instruments to make sure that this doesn’t happen. We just have to update and make full use of them. The golden path, I insist, would be to amend the Rome Statutes aligning the ICC jurisdiction on the crime of aggression with that already in place on genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\\nIf no agreement can be reached on this promptly, however, we should then push for the establishment of a special tribunal. The crucial point is to send a very clear message. There can and must be no impunity for the devastating consequences of this aggression, and those responsible must be prosecuted. We owe it to all the innocent victims of these barbaric crimes. They will not go unheeded. Not now. Not ever.\\n\\n52, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-12-15, EN, The humanitarian situation in Ukraine due to Russia’s attacks against critical infrastructure and civilian areas (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-15-INT-4-097-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, dear Commissioner, horrible war crimes have been committed daily in the past ten months. We have heard accounts of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, torture, illicit use of weapons and the use of illicit weapons. And now also massive attacks against critical civilian infrastructures, preventing even hospitals from working properly and putting civilians, even babies and kids under the threat of frost and cold. \\nA strong and unequivocal international legal response to the aggression against Ukraine, to this predatory and imperialist war unleashed by Russia, permitting no place for impunity for serious violations, and emphasising the legal responsibility of the perpetrators is therefore of utmost importance. \\nAnd I use the occasion to call once more on the Union to update and integrate the decision of 2011 on ICC with a strong position on the crime of aggression, as called by our Resolution 2014, and to promote the reform of the Rome Statute aimed at aligning the ICC jurisdiction on the crime of aggression with that already in place of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \\n\\n53, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-12-13, EN, Prospects for the two-State solution for Israel and Palestine (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-13-INT-2-420-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, we often discuss here in the European Parliament on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and on the prospects for its resolution. It seems to me, though, that we are somehow disconnected from the situation on the ground. The reality of violence the people living in those lands are experiencing each and every day as we keep repeating on liturgy on the two—State solution being the only possible one. Let me be clear: I completely agree on that and I support that. But I wonder what are we really doing in practice to facilitate such outcome? And it’s clear the process has come to a complete standstill and our Union is not doing enough, or anything, to reignite it.\\nDear colleagues, in the last period we have been discussing about strategic autonomy, about the need to find the EU’s place in the world, about being a more proactive geopolitical player, especially in our neighbourhoods. I can’t think of a better test to our determination than trying to facilitate a solution to a conflict that has been going on for far too long. We need a serious reflection on what we can do and especially on what we are willing to do. And most of all, we need concrete actions instead of never—ending discussions.\\n\\n55, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-11-09, EN, Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 20-21 October 2022 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-09-INT-1-058-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear Presidents, I am deeply disappointed by the fact that the last European Council was silent on updates on South Caucasus, where Azeri troops occupied 220 square kilometres of Armenian sovereign territory, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as executions and tortures. \\nHere I see many similarities with what is happening in Ukraine, with a democratic country, Armenia, being attacked by an aggressive authoritarian regime – but there are also differences that I cannot tolerate. Indeed, while rightfully supporting Kyiv against the barbaric behaviour of Putin’s regime, our Union is perceiving Azerbaijan as a reliable partner. And no, it’s not, because realpolitik cannot replace our values, and these double standards are undermining our credibility. \\nArmenia is a vibrant democracy that is not a Russian ally but, on the contrary, is simply a hostage of the Kremlin: its assertiveness and threatening attitude, and its decision to sacrifice Yerevan in exchange for a fully-fledged alliance with Baku and a complacency with Ankara. We must get out of this gas dependency trap, from all the authoritarian regimes, and the reluctance on a price cap is a huge mistake. \\nThe deployment of our monitoring mission is the first step, and its mandate should be extended permanently for all the time needed as well as the number of observers. But we need more, because blatant violations of international law should be condemned always and everywhere. I stand with democracy. I stand with Armenia.\\n\\n56, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-19, EN, EU-Western Balkans relations in light of the new enlargement package (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-236-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, moving further in the enlargement process is not only something we owe to our friends and partners in the Western Balkans, but it is also a strategic priority that has grown in relevance after the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.\\nIt is now clearer than ever that we need to reform the enlargement process further by moving beyond unanimity. I welcome the recommendation to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina the official status of candidate country, and I hope this could be that spark that the Sarajevo needs to double down on its commitments.\\nNow we need to keep on moving on the right path, and the next step must be the visa liberalisation for Kosovo. We do not advocate for shortcuts or cutting corners, but we must realise that we cannot afford never-ending negotiations and uncertainty at every step.\\nWith the first IGC, with Albania and North Macedonia in July, we have partially remedied some silly mistakes from the past and we must learn the lessons. We need a realistic timeline, otherwise the partial void in the region would be filled even more by Russia, China, Turkey and the Gulf, because the European project will never be completed until all the Western Balkan countries will be part of our family. \\n\\n57, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-19, EN, Political situation in Tunisia (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-323-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, I am deeply saddened by the trajectory of Tunisia, a country for which I deeply care. It was once defined as the lighthouse of democracy in North Africa and in the Muslim world. This light is now dimmed, and since President Saied’s decision to suspend and then to close the parliament, we have assisted to the painful process of dismantling the progresses achieved previously.\\nNow, the people are once again in the streets protesting against the illegal suspension of democracy, the judicial persecution of political leaders and NGO activists and the catastrophic economic and social situation with a constitution that was not shared by the large part of the population.\\nDear colleagues, I have an appeal and a request. The appeal is for Presidency Saied: it is not too late to bring back Tunisia on the right path. Do not deprive the brave Tunisian citizens for what they fought so hard for.\\nOn our side, it is time to reflect on our relationship. We helped and we must continue to help the Tunisian people in the future, but our support to the government cannot be unconditional. We need to see democracy clearly coming back in Tunisia, and we must be clear also with President Saied. Only in this way we can be a decisive player in bringing back the enticing aroma of jasmine that ten years ago led us to believe that a different path was, and is still, possible.\\n\\n58, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-18, EN, Question Time (Commission) - Protecting critical infrastructure in the EU against attacks and countering hybrid attacks, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-18-INT-2-282-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Dear Commissioner Schinas, ευχαριστώ πολύ – thank you very much for being here today with us. I believe this debate is extremely timely indeed.\\nThe sabotage of Nord Stream\\xa02 can be seen as an alarm bell that is telling us that we can be hurt substantially through physical actions, not to mention the already well—known capacity of third actors to interfere in our democratic processes through hybrid means.\\nWhile it is certainly true that we must create and empower ad hoc bodies and entities such as the hybrid response team, I have always considered it essential to follow a whole—of—government and whole—of—society approach in order to increase our resilience. To this extent, the strategic compass clearly states that one of the main points will be a reinforcement of the cyber diplomacy toolbox. Therefore, I would like to ask you to elaborate further on the way forward for moving this will from paper to concrete actions.\\nWill it be possible to include provisions on cyber actions in the international agreements that we signed for trying to prevent cyber attacks as much as possible?\\nAnd what about the diplomatic responses to be put in place in case these efforts fail?\\n\\n59, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-05, EN, Humanitarian situation after the devastating floods in Pakistan and the climate crisis (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-05-INT-3-326-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, Commissioner, torrential monsoon rains triggered the most severe flooding in Pakistan’s recent history, washing away entire villages, killing over 1\\xa0600 people and displacing more than 33\\xa0million. This climate-induced disaster is leaving behind a trail of destruction, starvation and diseases. With a vast area of Pakistan likely to take months to dry out, waterborne diseases are spiking, as well as malnutrition, especially among children. \\nDespite all the efforts of the international community, volunteers and the government, the unprecedented nature of the floods has resulted in a huge resource gap and Pakistan’s already overwhelmed health—care system lacks the resources to help all those who need treatment now. The lives of 100\\xa0000 more people are under threat as a second disaster looms within the first one. \\nIt’s imperative, under our principle of international solidarity, commitment and burden sharing, to answer the demands to increase cooperation and mobilise much more funds. But it will not be enough to increase humanitarian aid in an attempt to curb the possible risk of epidemics. To support the country at this dramatic time, action will have to be taken to support Pakistan’s reconstruction, rehabilitation and resilience, including through debt relief measures. It is not a time for fine words, but for immediate and effective action. \\n\\n60, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-05, EN, The Media freedom crackdown in Myanmar, notably the cases of Htet Htet Khine, Sithu Aung Myint and Nyein Nyein Aye, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-05-INT-3-367-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, ‘the only security of all is in a free press’. These were the words of Thomas Jefferson, and they are more appropriate than ever to describe the appalling situation in Myanmar. Indeed, abolishing media freedom the military junta has razed whatever level of security for the people of Myanmar, granting itself liberty and impunity for committing barbarian acts such as those described in the resolution presented today.\\nWhat is even more impressive, yet very far from surprising, is that this brutal junta enjoys support from those authoritarian states we constantly criticise from this House, namely Russia and China, who are blocking every action potentially taken by the UN Security Council.\\nFrom this House, we must be absolutely firm in condemning the behaviour of the Tatmadaw and those who stand on their side. We should suspend the preferential status for commerce and every privilege they have and encourage the EU delegation and the diplomatic missions of the Member States to offer all practical support to those who risk their lives every day.\\nWe call for an immediate arms embargo on Myanmar. The people of Myanmar have been forced to silence. We must be their spokespersons. Otherwise, also our freedom will result void and useless.\\n\\n61, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-05, EN, The recent humanitarian and human rights situation in Tigray, Ethiopia, notably that of children, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-05-INT-3-389-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, in less than a month, the conflict in Ethiopia will enter its third year. Thousands of people have lost their lives and children and women, as usual, are the first victims. We have discussed this topic dozens of times, and I believe it is time to scale up our efforts, acting in three main ways. \\nIn the immediate term, we must guarantee humanitarian support to those in need, making sure that this aid reaches the local population. Then we must exploit this momentum, which seems favourable for the reopening negotiations. Indeed, our Union should provide all diplomatic support to the African Union without the intention to guide the process but assisting the negotiators in finding African solutions for two African problems.\\nAnd afterwards, in the medium term, we need to be on the forefront for ensuring that any peace agreement can last, providing financial and practical expertise for the retrieval of weapons that are currently in possession of combatants, especially civilians forced to embrace the arms. \\nOur African counterparts have created an ambitious agenda for silencing the guns. Let us show that we are on their side, not only when tragedies happen, but every day until the guns will leave space for real human development.\\n\\n65, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-10-03, EN, Impact of new technologies on taxation: crypto and blockchain (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-03-INT-1-124-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, in May 2021, there were about 9\\xa0000 different cryptocurrencies with a market capitalisation of almost EUR\\xa02\\xa0trillion, driven mainly by Bitcoin, the most popular one with a market capitalisation of Bitcoin that was about 850\\xa0billion. The simulated potential revenue of taxing capital gains from Bitcoin in 2020 amounts to EUR\\xa0900\\xa0million, almost 0.3\\xa0% of total tax revenue for property taxation in the EU. These numbers make enough clear how much is urgent to act on the taxation of cryptocurrencies. \\nFirst, the Commission should assess the ways in which different Member States tax crypto-assets and the different national policies regarding the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion in the field of crypto-assets, underlining best practices and potential loopholes. Then the Member States should consider the specificities of the use of those assets in their national tax reforms to implement more effective systems that guarantee the fair, transparent, proportionate taxation of crypto-assets. \\nWould that be enough? Of course not. The only real solution always remains a unique fiscal policy at the EU level. How many years will we still have to waste before figuring it out? \\n\\n66, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-09-14, EN, Human rights violations in the context of forced deportation of Ukrainian civilians to and forced adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-09-14-INT-3-319-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, according to reliable estimates, several hundred thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been forcibly deported to Russia, especially to the unpopulated regions in the far east of the country. This is also the area from which the overwhelming majority of the reportedly dead Russian soldiers were coming. Furthermore, and even more detestable, more than 250\\xa0000 children have been listed for adoption to Russian families, again in the least populous areas of the country. \\nThe plan here is crystal clear. The Russian regime does not plan to stop sending these young men and women to die for a brutal and unjustifiable war. Instead, they have already started to substitute those who fall with other innocent human beings, disrespecting all basic international laws. \\nDear colleagues, it is not the first time that this happens. Some of you perfectly know what Russian deportation looks like, since your countries have experienced that during the 20th century. From this House, we have already said, ‘never again’. Yet it is happening right now again. We must stand firm in condemning these atrocities, and we call on the international community to immediately open an investigation and to bring all those responsible, including Putin, of this atrocity accountable in front of the International Criminal Court. \\n\\n67, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-09-13, EN, Question Time (VPC/HR) The state of play of the war in Ukraine, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-09-13-INT-2-244-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – At the G7 summit earlier this month, the leaders of the participating countries agreed to set a price cap for Russian oil exports, triggering a strong reaction from the Russian side, with Putin declaring that in case this happens, he would stop exporting oil to Europe. Therefore, dear Josep, I would like to ask you to elaborate a bit further on our possibility to enforce this decision without generating a boomerang effect on our economies and on our citizens. One of the main options put forward by the analysts is to deny Russia the access to the London insurance market, which covers around 95\\xa0% of the global oil shipping. Do you think this would be a sufficient deterrent? And is there a consensus among the EU Member States to proceed this way? Also, I believe that one of the main objectives of our elections should be to enlarge the number of countries worldwide that would support this initiative, in order to consolidate the bloc of liberal democracies opposing this barbaric war. Is there any outreach plan to foster cooperation with our partners? And how is it looking at the current stage? \\n\\n68, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-09-13, EN, The situation in the Strait of Taiwan (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-09-13-INT-2-258-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, Commissioner, High Representative, when we talk about Taiwan, there’s only one question that really matters: what can we do in practice to avoid the conflict that has been long predicted, that could have catastrophic human costs, and that would represent yet another attempt from autocratic powers to eradicate democracy from their neighbourhoods as it is happening in Ukraine?\\nI believe there is only one answer. We have to support Taiwan in making clear that the costs of an invasion would be unbearable for Beijing. As we cannot the risk of military escalation, we have to rely on what has always been the hallmark of our external action: diplomacy and commercial strength. To do so, it is paramount that we remain united among ourselves, willing to scale up our relations with Taipei, including through our bilateral investment agreements, and act as a monolith in countering China’s attempts to destabilize us through propaganda and trade retaliation. Therefore, I commend Lithuania for opening its trade office in Taiwan, and I expect more Member States as well as our Union as a whole to show the same courage, demonstrating to the world that we stand united in defending our defining values, that we stand firmly next to the brave and democratic people of Taiwan.\\n\\n69, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-07-06, EN, Taxing windfall profits of energy companies (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-07-06-INT-3-324-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, Commissioner, as inflation in the EU shot to a new record in June, cost increases are exacting a deep toll on the economy, eating into most Europeans’ wages.\\nBut for many of our largest companies and their shareholders, it has been a very different story. The pandemic, the war and the supply chain bottlenecks have created a smokescreen that allows companies to pass on inflationary costs to consumers via price increases. Is it appropriate that during all this uncertainty that this be a moment in which large corporations continue to enjoy huge profits?\\nA temporary tax that would apply to excess profits of all multinational companies is for sure a good starting point. But the long—term solution must be to reform our laws to tax the companies that benefit most from the EU’s internal market, and to stop the corporate tax-dodging that is rampant today through a global minimum tax.\\nLet’s bring in the revenue we need to support working families, and accelerate the shift to renewable energies. And let’s make this year the last year any company with massive profits pays almost no corporate tax in the EU. Now it’s really time for change.\\n\\n70, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-07-05, EN, 2021 Report on Bosnia and Herzegovina (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-07-05-INT-2-333-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, dear colleagues, as the main outcome of the last European Council, we have applauded the decision to give Ukraine and Moldova EU candidate status. While this was an essential political message aiming at reaffirming our undiminished commitment for the future membership of the countries in the Western partnership, this fast track is causing turbulences in the Western Balkans.\\nFor this reason, the Council’s readiness to grant candidate status to Bosnia is a very important step as we cannot risk further disenchantment and we cannot give the impression that we are leaving the Western Balkans behind. The implementation of the commitments, as set out in the political agreement reached on 12\\xa0June 2022, will be paramount and I strongly hope that after the Commission reports on the 14 key priorities, as requested by the Council, we’ll swiftly welcome Bosnia Herzegovina as an official candidate.\\nDear colleagues, delaying further the inevitable EU perspective for the Balkans in the EU is like playing with fire as there is a concrete risk that they will look elsewhere. As we perfectly know where this ‘elsewhere’ is, I am sure we don’t want that to happen.\\n\\n71, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-05-18, EN, 2021 Report on North Macedonia (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-18-INT-1-159-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, dear Commissioner, despite undiminished popular support for European integration, trust in the EU as the most important partner and ally for North Macedonia has dropped by 30% in the last two years. This tells us a lot about our relationship with this country which, since it embraced the European perspective in 2004, has undergone significant reforms and international efforts – even changing its official name. Now it is time to give concreteness to Macedonia’s EU aspirations, or it will be too late.\\nJune may represent the point of no return. Supporting the accession negotiation means strengthening the EU’s role and credibility in the whole Western Balkans region. It means strengthening reformers throughout the region and contrasting and weakening those anti—European forces that depict us as unreliable, and the European future of the Western Balkans as an illusion.\\nThe Commission report on North Macedonia stresses once again how the country has met all the conditions to start negotiations. This Parliament strongly agrees. Our High Representative agrees and – as he referred – the Foreign Affairs Council agrees. We owe it to this country. We owe it to the leaders who reach out to neighbours and minorities at home in the true spirit of reconciliation. We owe it to the North Macedonian people.\\n\\n72, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-05-18, EN, 2021 Report on Albania (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-18-INT-1-188-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, the status in which we have relegated Albania is something we cannot afford anymore as the geopolitics of our neighbourhood is showing us once again, if there was still any doubt, how the enlargement perspective of the Western Balkans is more important than ever.\\nI fully agree with High Representative Borrell when he says that this situation is not only harming the candidate countries but is also harming us, presenting tremendous costs in terms of credibility and political perspective. It gives to Russia and other players who want us weak and divided.\\nDear colleagues, Albania has made its homework. Albania has achieved concrete reforms and real progress, and is demonstrating its willingness to advance in its accession process. Now it’s our turn to deliver. There’s still a chance in the June Council to remedy this historical error.\\nMy plea to our Bulgarian friends is to lift their veto so that the Council can do finally the right thing. We have huge challenges coming in the near future. We are all aware of that, and I strongly believe that we can better face them if we overcome our divisions.\\nDear colleagues, the time is now. We can’t wait anymore because the rest of the world won’t wait for us. Albania is Europe. Europe must be together with Albania.\\n\\n73, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-05-04, EN, Reports of continued organ harvesting in China, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-04-INT-3-339-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, Madam Commissioner, it is beyond reasonable doubt that in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practised – this is the conclusion of the China Tribunal – from persons not clinically dead, according to a recent study by the Australian National University. \\nThe targets are well known – Falun Gong, Tibetans, Muslims, Christians and Uyghurs. People treated like livestock, subjected to compulsory health checks, just to be sure their organs can be harvested. \\nDear colleagues, this is the one of the worst atrocities committed in modern times and without a doubt an outstanding crime against humanity. Despite our helplessness in affecting Beijing policies, as seen yet again at the recent EU—China summit, we can’t stop trying to use all our pressure to finally achieve some concrete steps.\\nFor this reason, I call for a full and transparent international investigation to shed light on these appalling violations, as well as for additional strong, targeted sanctions for those who are responsible for that. \\nWe need to use all means at our disposal, including commercial tools, so that Beijing faces up to its responsibilities. More than anything, as EU representatives and even more as human beings, we need to keep being the voice of those who do not have one – loudly denouncing a situation which is just unacceptable. Because if we don’t do that, no one will.\\n\\n74, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-05-03, EN, The follow up of the Conference on the Future of Europe (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-03-INT-2-262-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, thank you very much, dear colleagues, despite the initial scepticism of some Eurosceptical governments, the Conference on the Future of Europe turned out to be a success, empowering participative democracy at its outmost and putting long-sighted proposals on the table.\\nNow it is time to move forward, to achieve citizens’ goals and hopes, turning them into concrete actions. And there is only one way to do so. We must open a new convention for discussing the much-needed deep revision of the Treaties towards a federal Europe. And as this would be a clear divide in the history of the European integration, there would be no better place than Ventotene Island, where everything began, to do so.\\nWe are in front of a crossroads. We can move towards a genuine political union, a strategically autonomous union, moving to qualified majority, and thus growing into a real player at the global stage. Or we can remain divided, becoming the chessboard where other actors play their geopolitical games as is happening with the criminal aggression of Ukraine.\\nOnly a new treaty of Ventotene can allow us to pursue the first option. And if the main road is the convention, we must also be prepared to cope with certain national reluctances or blockages, thus foreseeing back-up solutions, including the possibility to set up new forms of reinforced cooperations. Let’s finally sit around the negotiation table. There will be an understanding of who wants to be on the right side of history and who does not. We stand for a Treaty of Ventotene, for a free, democratic, sovereign and federal Europe.\\n(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card speech)\\n\\n75, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-05-03, EN, The follow up of the Conference on the Future of Europe (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-03-INT-2-264-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI),  blue-card reply. – Thank you, my answer is very clear in that regard. I stand for the strengthening of the European integration moving towards a federal Europe because I truly believe that, otherwise, facts will decide instead of us.\\nAs is happening right now with the criminal invasion of Ukraine, as happened many times also with the multiple crisis we were experiencing in the last decades. And I must, of course, underline the fact that we did not always have all the tools we needed to face and tackle these crisis. Sometimes we have been a bit original and creative, we found an ambitious solution, like Next Generation EU, but I am calling for a permanent structural common European debt and a real federal budget to tackle the global challenges in front of us. So, for me, this is the main road that I am going to stand for and defend as well as you. But I also hope that it will be the outcome of the Conference and the Convention, because the citizens were very clear in that regard and their voice must be listened to. Otherwise, we will just fuel and foster frustration instead of more commitment towards European integration.\\n\\n76, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-05-03, EN, EU preparedness against cyber-attacks following Russia invasion on Ukraine (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-03-INT-2-302-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, according to some analysts, after the Russian criminal invasion of Ukraine, cyberattacks against the EU and its Member States have increased by 1000%. It goes without saying that these numbers must represent a wake—up call for us. \\nThe number one priority must be to pursue strategic autonomy and technological serenity, pledging adequate resources to this end. In particular, a shift of approach is really required. We can no longer focus only on hardware capabilities, but we need to include ambitious projects on the research and development of specific software. Otherwise, we will always remain dependent on third parties.\\nSecond, we should insist on those success stories which already exist, such as ENISA, whose role should be further enhanced. At the same time, and even more in line with the prerogative of our House, we need to streamline cyber diplomacy with the final aim to create a safe, reliable and open cyberspace worldwide. The cyber domain represents the apotheosis of interconnection among EU Member States and, even more than in other fields, there are no individual countries that can boast a satisfactory and independent level of security. Let’s make this field the pilot for further European integration. \\n\\n77, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-04-05, EN, Question Time with the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy - Security and the EU\\'s strategic compass, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-05-INT-2-308-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Dear High Representative, first of all let me congratulate you and the whole EEAS for having completed this unprecedented exercise that will give more coherence, ambition and renewed impetus to our approach to global politics. \\nMoving decisively towards the Europeanisation of security and defence is something we cannot delay further, and the Russian criminal invasion of Ukraine represents yet another wake—up call. Eventually we have a guiding light, well—intentioned, in the Strategic Compass. \\nMy question for you is the following: the Russian criminal invasion forced us to react swiftly and in an unprecedented manner, and we could do it only thanks to the European Peace Facility. This instrument has proven to be an added value to our toolbox, allowing us to transfer military equipment to Ukrainian armed forces. However, the resources allocated for 2022 are already over, while the challenges we are facing are definitely not. \\nTherefore, I would like to ask you whether there is an intention to frontload the resources in order to keep on supporting Ukraine, while also providing sufficient funding to several other partners, especially the African Union and its neighbours, to set up an effective continental security apparatus. \\n\\n78, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-04-05, EN, Question Time with the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy - Security and the EU\\'s strategic compass, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-05-INT-2-310-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Thank you very much. It’s certainly true that the most urgent issue to be addressed is the criminal invasion of Ukraine. And I am convinced that we can be a decisive actor in the conflict with several means in our variegated toolbox. However, we must not forget also the threats that we are facing, that they are variegated and they come from all strategic directions. \\nTherefore, how will we ensure that sufficient attention and funding will be given also to the European Southern Neighbourhood? Will we increase our capabilities for operating theatres that are different from those present in the East and will the renewed impetus for military mobility keep this need into account?\\n\\n79, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-04-05, EN, Outcome of the EU-China Summit (1 April 2022) (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-05-INT-2-389-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, High Representative, dear colleagues, I appreciated the EU’s approach to the last summit. A difficult meeting where we arrived with many colleagues still under sanction by Beijing, let’s not forget it. And in an extremely complex international context, the results have been underwhelming, but not because of the EU’s lack of trying and this adds to its importance.\\nThe elephant in the room has obviously been the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the EU’s calls for help to end the conflict being answered by deliberate ambiguity, evasive responses and no explicit assurances from China. As politicians, we have to call facts and actions as we see them. And what I see is that China, with its wait and see attitude and its unwillingness to take a clear position, is in fact buying time for Putin, de facto helping him to continue with his bloody aggression war on the ground and attempting to change borders through the use of brute force.\\nThe U.S. must continue to call out Beijing to abandon this ambiguity, stressing that the step between a guilty silence and complicity is a short one, not compatible with China’s proclaimed aspiration to be a global player for peace and stability. If China wants to be on the right side of history, it has to take a decision now and it must be a clear one.\\n\\n81, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-03-10, EN, The situation of journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-10-INT-4-084-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, the growing stigmatisation, the weakening of institutions, the increase in violence and the diffuse impunity all provide a clear message: in Mexico, the press and freedom of expression overall are under siege. Since his election in 2018, López Obrador has not only failed to improve the country\\'s human rights record, but he has allowed the loss of many of the hard-fought gains activists, rights groups and campaigners have achieved since the end of one-party rule in Mexico. \\nThe Western world, the European Union included, has been noticeably silent regarding these accelerating attacks on democracy and fundamental rights. So far, the democratic clause of the global agreement has not resulted in any decisions or measures that help alleviate the continuous violation of human rights. If journalists and activists, especially activists for indigenous people’s human rights, are deliberately targeted and threatened while those who attacked them go unpunished, democracy itself is also under threat. \\nAs we are working at the modernisation of our joint comprehensive agreement, we need to be clear with the representatives – Mexico is a long-standing and, we stress in our resolution, vital partner of the EU – that the prospect of ratification is heavily reliant on improvement on human rights and on the government\\'s clear commitment to international standards and obligation.\\n¡Derechos y libertad para todos los periodistas y los activistas mexicanos! ¡No estáis solos!\\n\\n82, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-03-10, EN, Myanmar, one year after the coup, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-10-INT-4-099-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam President, the recent events made clear that we are facing a global battle: democracy versus authoritarianism; the rule of law versus the rule of power; respect for human rights against their total disregard. It’s a battle fought in different places with different means, and Ukraine’s invasion is only the most evident example. Nevertheless, it is the same fight.\\nOne of the battlegrounds is in Myanmar. Since the coup in February 2021, the situation has continuously worsened. Some 1\\xa0500 civilians were killed, 12\\xa0000 arrested, 84 sentenced to death. Numbers that bring back ghosts from the past. China and Russia have taken a clear position in this fight. They block any attempt of the United Nations Security Council to draft a resolution. They legitimise the junta, which supports Putin’s war on Ukraine, also providing it with military means that are used every day in the repression.\\nWords fall on deaf ears. We need strong action instead. New and more stringent measures, coordinated international pressure, the referral of the situation to the International Criminal Court and the immediate suspension of Myanmar from GSP and EBA trade preferences. Yesterday was already late, Madam Commissioner. We need to use all instruments at our disposal and stay united, because their civil society should not feel abandoned and because this is a fight for democracy we can’t afford to lose.\\n\\n83, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-03-10, EN, Destruction of cultural heritage in Nagorno-Karabakh, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-10-INT-4-123-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, in these days, we are all deeply moved by the criminal invasion of Ukraine, for which Putin created unacceptable justifications. He falsified the past, bending history to his propaganda needs, and he is trying to prevent a sovereign country from choosing its own future. \\nSimilar trends are present in Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azerbaijan’s authorities are trying to eradicate the cultural heritage of the autochthonous Armenian population in the territories they occupied with brute force. Monuments, medieval monasteries, churches, tombs: there is no respect for either the living or the dead. Cancelling the past, their leadership intends to criminally justify the future they have in mind for the region, and we cannot accept and let it happen. \\nFrom this House we must speak clearly. We call on the Azerbaijan authorities to immediately halt this barbaric vandalism and to open a constructive and inclusive dialogue in the region. Furthermore, we encourage UNESCO to put in place its fact-finding mission, and we must support their endeavours, also taking a strong position vis-à-vis Baku’s reluctance to allow such deployment. As the Roman philosopher Cicero said, history is the witness of time, the light of truth, the teacher of life and is committed to immortality. Therefore, it cannot be rewritten to justify expansionist and imperialistic ambitions. \\n\\n85, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2022-03-01, EN, Russian aggression against Ukraine (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-01-INT-1-051-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, today, we are not simply condemning an unjustifiable aggression. Today, we stand up united in this House to face the criminal invasion of an authoritarian regime against international law, our principles, our values, therefore against all of us.\\nPutin’s cynical bet assumes he would quickly overthrow the Ukrainian democracy with these divisions on the ground, but also brings other divisions no less dangerous through propaganda and fear within our countries, among our peoples. Our bond and duty is to make sure that he will fail. With our resolute support to the resistance in Ukraine and its official recognition as EU candidate and with the immediate adoption of a new solidarity package based on common European bonds. We must immediately support also our companies and families who will suffer the dire consequences of the dutiful sets of sanctions aimed at bringing Moscow to the negotiating table.\\nThis is not the war of all the Russians. This is a crime perpetrated by a tyrant and his accomplices. Thousands of citizens are bravely taking to the streets to shout their clear ‘no’, risking their lives to oppose his imperialistic ravings. They deserve our full support.\\nThis existential threat is a crucial moment in our history and calls for exceptional efforts.

Also taking account of Erdoğan’s unacceptable affront and the fact that once again our open hands towards Ankara have been received with a slap, we would be foolish not to draw the necessary conclusions and ask Erdoğan to put an end to this waltz of ambiguities to which he accustoms us, forcing us to carry out a serious examination of conscience. \\nWhile we rightly attack Ankara on the withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention – a predictable paradox – a less predictable paradox is affecting us. Only 21 EU Member States have ratified it and, in the Polish Parliament, a text is under consideration that calls for its exit. This is a contradiction that undermines our credibility and exposes us to those who want to use our weaknesses against us. Having allowed Erdoğan to blackmail us on the issue of migration and refugees is solely and exclusively our responsibility. The EU must be cohesive and consistent internally to be incisive and credible outside. It is time to abandon the weakness of hypocrisy, to act in concert with our allies, with President\\xa0Biden, to really defend our values and principles in the Mediterranean.\\n\\n270, Fabio Massimo CASTALDO, 2020-01-16, EN, Burundi, notably the freedom of expression, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-16-INT-4-052-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Fabio Massimo Castaldo (NI),  blue-card answer. – Thank you very much for this important question. First of all let me say that it is true: it is not the only country, but that’s why it is even more important than ever that we will respect of the human rights clause in the Cotonou agreement. It has never been effectively applied, and above all we must look into not only suspending our cooperation funds, but also eventually implementing targeted sanctions against those responsible for these atrocities.\\nWe are speaking in Burundi of a covert genocide because still there is a conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi in the country as happened in Rwanda. And of course let me say that we must try to use our leverage and to ensure a united position of the European countries. We cannot allow some of our Member States to negotiate behind our back, not respecting the official position of the High Representative and, of course, the official position of the EU.\\n\\n1, Raphaël GLUCKSMANN, 2023-12-13, EN, Preparation of the European Council meeting of 14-15 December 2023 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-13-INT-3-044-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Raphaël Glucksmann (S&D),  blue-card answer. – I will stop to be weak. And that’s what we have done with Orban for ages. We gave him the power to actually hold us hostages.

That’s what I will tell. \\n\\n4, Raphaël GLUCKSMANN, 2023-12-12, EN, European Economic Security Strategy (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-12-INT-2-424-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Vladimír Bilčík (PPE).   – Madam President, Vice-Presidents, colleagues, this proposal arrives at an important time as we approach the European elections in a few months and I’m very proud of our work in fighting foreign interference in the INGE and ING2 special committees in the European Parliament.\\nSadly, we are being proven right almost every day about how important this topic is. I believe that our special committees’ commitment has been instrumental in shaping the discourse around foreign interference, and it is encouraging to see that the Commission also reflected on our discussions and recommendations.\\nWhile this package reflects a commitment to protecting European democracy from malign interference, there is room for further action. No matter how well designed a communication from the Commission, its success ultimately depends on how seriously politicians in Member States take it. We must do more on both national and European level, and we must constantly respond to the threats.\\nI also want to highlight the important role of investigative journalists who uncover cases of foreign interference. These contributions are essential in raising awareness and understanding of foreign interference, and we as politicians must do our part in spreading the awareness.\\nThe defence of democracy is a good start, but I am in favour of stronger instruments in the future. I see this as a good kick-off, but it must evolve and strengthen over time for the sake of a more vigilant and truly resilient democracy in Europe. After all – and this is the bottom line – defence of democracy is a core business of not just this House, but of all public institutions in Europe.\\n\\n21, Raphaël GLUCKSMANN, 2023-02-14, EN, Establishment of an independent EU Ethics Body (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-14-INT-2-350-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Raphaël Glucksmann (S&D),  blue-card reply. – Well actually that’s not the name I would have picked, because in France, if I’m quoting my country – sometimes it does things right – it’s called the high authority on the transparency of public life, which I think is better because we should not put it on the moral ground. It’s a question of the survival of democracy. It’s a political issue, and it’s a legal issue. It’s not a moral issue. I don’t care if you are not moral. What I care is that you respect the rules and you respect the trust of the people who voted for you and sent you in these institutions. So if I were to write it, I would call it the high authority on the transparency of public life.\\n\\n27, Raphaël GLUCKSMANN, 2022-12-14, EN, Chinese government crackdown on the peaceful protests across the People\\'s Republic of China, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-14-INT-3-446-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Raphaël Glucksmann (S&D).  (blue-card reply) – The fact is that today we are – if we want it or if we don’t want it – connected to this crackdown. How? Through the value chain of our companies. Through the export of the goods produced by forced labour. \\nFor instance, if you take things that we need most of all now for the Green Deal, which are solar panels, yes? How are they produced? They are produced by Uyghur slaves. And why? Because we don’t produce them ourselves. So that’s why it’s so important to change, to change the rules of the game so that we can have a market that is free from these goods. If we don’t do it, it means we are collaborating with the repression and the crackdown. That is also why we need these resolutions to point the finger when it hurts, where it hurts, and when we want them to be hurt. \\n\\n30, Raphaël GLUCKSMANN, 2022-10-18, EN, Question Time (Commission) - Protecting critical infrastructure in the EU against attacks and countering hybrid attacks, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-18-INT-2-241-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Raphaël Glucksmann (S&D).   – Thank you. And hello, Vice-President. I have a question on the attacks, but you already responded. My question will be, therefore, on money.\\nI mean, how can you tell us that what happened with Germany and the strategic gas storage owned by Gazprom cannot happen anymore? And what do we do about Huawei investments, for instance, in critical infrastructure? Is there any plan to actually address the fact that such kind of companies cannot have any say in our infrastructure?\\nAnd second point, what’s inside this defence of democracy package that President of the Commission came and announced in front of the Parliament? We were all very happy about it. But what will you put in it that would make sure that infrastructure that is critical for democracies – like, for instance, the Belgian Parliament which could not actually have a debate on Uyghurs – will not be attacked anymore? What kind of sanctions, what kind of protection?\\n\\n31, Raphaël GLUCKSMANN, 2022-10-18, EN, Question Time (Commission) - Protecting critical infrastructure in the EU against attacks and countering hybrid attacks, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-18-INT-2-243-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Raphaël Glucksmann (S&D).   – Mr President, very good question. Thank you for your response. I like it very much. It has been fun, by the way.

When will we have a total clean—up of our institutions that are supposed to protect and guarantee our security?\\n\\n15, Brando BENIFEI, 2023-09-11, EN, Amendments to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure with a view to strengthening integrity, independence and accountability (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-11-INT-1-111-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Brando Benifei (S&D),  blue-card answer. – I think it’s very delicate when we put a limit on the activity of a parliamentarian. So we need to consider these issues with care and with attention. However, I think that the rules we are putting in this text are simply increasing transparency and an overall control on our democratic procedures, a form of collective scrutiny.\\nSo, I think we should never underestimate this issue. We need to consider the freedom of the mandate, the freedom to have any idea that is compatible with democratic values in this Chamber, to be protected, but at the same time, we need to protect democracy from the risk of corruption and external influence.\\n\\n16, Brando BENIFEI, 2023-07-13, EN, Global Convergence on Generative AI (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-13-INT-4-044-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Brando Benifei,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, we are happy to have you today for this very timely debate that was proposed together with some other colleagues. Generative AI is the hot topic of the moment, and for the last few months we have all witnessed the amazing things it can do, to the point that human creations are now often totally indistinguishable from AI ones. This opens up countless opportunities for innovation, but also raises a lot of concerns on privacy, IP rights, disinformation, environment, jobs, etc. This is why Parliament has put forward an ambitious proposal, a light but targeted legislative intervention in the AI Act regarding the generative AI. That was approved – the old text of the AI Act – just one month ago, and we are happy now to see signs of openness by the Commission and also by some Member States to consider these ideas, in particular our call for these systems to label their content so as to indicate that these are generated by an AI. We have also dealt with the specific issue of deepfakes, of the production of illegal content and of the copyright protection.\\nBack when the first letter on the request for a moratorium on these systems was published, we replied by making concrete proposals for global initiatives, as we are convinced that stopping the development of these technologies is not realistic. Instead, it needs to be governed. This is why we welcome the initiatives taken by several Commissioners to take immediate action at the international level. But let me be very clear: voluntary pacts or codes of conduct must not be a way to undermine the legislative process that is going on in parallel and which we hope to finalise in the upcoming months with a great sense of urgency, as this Parliament has been at the forefront of AI regulation and governance since our very first resolution in 2016, and we are now instrumental on the first ever regulation on AI.\\nThis is one of the many reasons why we need to reiterate our long—standing call for a parliamentary dimension to the Trade and Technology Council. Global cooperation on AI, in particular with trusted partners, is crucial, but it cannot happen behind closed doors, as it has been the case so far. We know our American colleagues in Congress share the same view. We talk with them. So we strongly call on you to finally deliver on this without further ado.\\n\\n20, Brando BENIFEI, 2023-06-14, EN, Artificial Intelligence Act (A9-0188/2023 - Brando Benifei, Dragoş Tudorache)  (vote), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-14-INT-3-103-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Brando Benifei,  rapporteur. – Madam President, dear colleagues, myself and Dragoş are very proud to present you this compromise text. It will be an historical vote where we not only address the most pressing issues with AI, but we also give a clear message to the rest of the world on how we think it should be done; how we can preserve our democracies and support innovation at the same time. I want to thank all of you who participated in this work. It’s been a collective effort. Let’s deliver together now. Let’s vote.\\n\\n22, Brando BENIFEI, 2023-06-13, EN, Artificial Intelligence Act (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-192-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Brando Benifei,  rapporteur. – Madam President, I thank the Vice-President and all the colleagues for the debate. Thanks to my co-rapporteur Dragoș Tudorache and all the shadow rapporteurs for this great work, and also their contribution to this discussion that has been showing also the different angles to which we can look at the topic.\\nI think it emerged very clearly that we need to work very strongly on some innovations that came after we have been starting this work. We started doing it with generative AI, with our proposal on general purpose AI, and this will be crucial that we maintain this ambition when we negotiate with the Council on these topics that are, we can say, on the forefront of the of the work. We need to defend our approach that strengthens fundamental rights, that has been clear, for example, with the fundamental rights impact assessment.\\nBut also I think it is important that we put value to our effort to strengthen innovation, to support start-ups with the work on the sandboxes. I think we did a thorough job on this, and I think it is important to clarify that, as was said earlier by the Commissioner, that when the worst happens, we can act. This is something we all agree on and we know that with this text, we the text that came out of the committee with the usage of non-real time, biometric identification in cases that are to pursue crimes that have been already committed and, with the control of a judge, we can pursue this balance.\\nI wanted to specify this because I heard many colleagues speaking on this topic, but I think it’s important to clarify that the existing text is already very advanced and clear, and that is also why I think we should keep the text that we voted in the committee. We are ready to work for the upcoming trilogues. Thank you for all the work and for the efforts to put this chamber, this Parliament, at the centre of the effort to build a human-centric AI, not just for us but for the whole world.\\n\\n31, Brando BENIFEI, 2023-04-18, EN, The need for European solidarity in saving lives in the Mediterranean, in particular in Italy (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-04-18-INT-2-387-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Brando Benifei (S&D),  blue-card response. – The state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Meloni is just another way to hide the difficulties of the government: as they are unable to provide sustainable solutions, they declare a state of emergency and they try to distract the public opinion – and also the European opinion – from the difficulties of the government to achieve the real results we need from them. So to spend the amount of resources that we have from the NextGenerationEU and to pursue a policy in favour of the purchasing power of Italian families and to sustain the economy.

On one hand, we need to forbid what should not be happening already. At the same time, we also have a general interest – and the Parliament expressed itself already many times – to have an ethics body that is able to confront with these issues. We have different opinions in this room, but let’s not mix different things. It’s a series of actions that we need to take. Forbid what should be forbidden, clarify what should be clarified and also have a general ethics body.

I think the transnational lists will be a good opportunity for all of us. It’s not true that they will put us far from our voters. Instead, we can be really able to Europeanise elections and to not talk only about our national priorities, but also looking from the campaign already to the next mandate, to priorities and what we will fight for. I think it’s a very good improvement. It will be a good change for a European Union that will be more and more united and able to offer European parties with a real system where our heads of the lists can be our Spitzenkandidaten to lead our fight for a more political and so stronger European Commission.

Along with training more healthcare staff and supporting research, the EU4Health programme presents a leap forward in the health of our citizens. The pandemic exposed the vulnerability of our healthcare systems as we experienced care disruptions, medical shortages, health system inadequacy, and insufficient and unequal access to healthcare. So, there is a need for a common health policy that allows EU countries to properly cooperate and coordinate in times of crisis and to strengthen our capacity to respond to new cross-border health threats. \\nDuring the early stages of the pandemic especially, Europe reckoned with shortages in necessary medical supplies and medicines due to disruption and bottlenecks in global supply chains. We all agree that we can no longer have such dependence on one or two countries in key markets. To do this, we must help manufacture and produce more medicines in Europe, and by so doing, we will strengthen the Union to the benefit of all our citizens. And as our very dear Commissioner said in her opening remarks, with EUR\\xa05.1 billion, a lot can be achieved – 12 times more than the previous mandate. A good news story.\\n\\n3, Ignazio CORRAO, 2022-12-13, EN, Renewable Energy, Energy Performance of Buildings and Energy Efficiency Directives: amendments (REPowerEU) (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-13-INT-2-038-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, good morning Mr\\xa0Executive Vice—President. Yesterday, a historic scientific breakthrough was announced. In ten years, nuclear fusion might power a completely decarbonised energy system. But we are still talking about ten years at least.\\nWhat do we do until then? Shall we keep growing our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign countries that produce them? Doesn’t seem very wise. Shall we keep pouring water on conventional nuclear plants and sweep their waste under the rug?\\nThe solution in the meanwhile is investing in solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps. This is the cheapest and fastest way to decarbonise the energy system now. And we need to accelerate because the climate crisis does not wait for administrative procedures to be done. Citizens are on our side, on this as long as we let them be part of the process and aid their advantage on the process, on bills, for example, and don’t impose choices on them.\\nCitizens are actually the power that our renewable energy system is built on.\\n\\n4, Ignazio CORRAO, 2022-06-23, EN, Gas storage (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-23-INT-2-021-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, at the end, we reached a good compromise in the storage regulation in case of emergency as the scope to protect our citizens and households. However, we could do more with the ban on Russian gas, which should not be used to fill up our storage facilities. I welcome the fact that energy efficiency has become part of the security of gas supply policy and the filling target mechanism, even if we are still far away from a real policy that would prioritise energy efficiency, savings and renewables. \\nWe should clearly understand that the disagreement is temporary because of the war and a geopolitical moment. I would like to remind the Commission that the real goal is the phasing out of gas and not its promotion. That’s why I say that this regulation and the next gas package are not completely aligned with the targets of the Paris Agreement or the Green Deal because there is still no decommissioning of gas infrastructures, and targets on energy efficiency and renewables are insufficient. \\n\\n6, Ignazio CORRAO, 2022-04-05, EN, Trans-European energy infrastructure (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-05-INT-2-089-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, everyone seems to finally understand how important it is to fund our European energy independence. That doesn’t mean stop using gas today, of course, but we can’t repeat the same mistakes made in the recent past.\\nRelying on more gas through different suppliers only creates new dependencies, draws away funds from investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and locks us into fossil infrastructure for decades. The final text, for example, allows for the Melita and EastMed gas pipelines to become PCIs and so to pump EU public funds into future stranded assets.\\nLast week, the European Commission presented an entire greenwashing proposal. Well, considering the position taken on gas infrastructure subsidies, it sounds quite hypocritical. The narrative that more gas imported from the US, Qatar or other third countries will reduce the bill of the European citizens is a fairy tale. We have the solutions and we just need to use them. Just for example, in Sicily, on 1\\xa0April, the electricity generated by wind and sun has covered all the energy needed in the island.\\n\\n7, Ignazio CORRAO, 2022-02-17, EN, The death penalty in Iran, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-17-INT-4-103-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, I am, as many of you colleagues, deeply alarmed by the increasing use of the death penalty against protesters, human rights defenders and dissidents, but also ethnic and religious minorities in Iran. In order not to seem only an external concern, I want to highlight the proposal in the joint motion that recognises citizen—led initiatives in Iran, such as petitions calling for an end to the death penalty and its disproportionate use against minorities and women.\\nIran is also one of the few countries in the world that executes minors, in clear violation of international law. There appears to be a state policy of intimidating, prosecuting or silencing those who call for accountability, justice and truth, whether they are victims themselves, relatives, human rights defenders, lawyers or organisations.\\nThe voices of Iranian citizens are brutally silenced by the regime, and yet these initiatives show that Iranian citizens want the death penalty practices to end. Because of this, the regime cannot claim that the demand to end the death penalty is only coming from outside Iran. Its own citizens want it to end. This is why the EU and the international community need to take urgent actions to let the voice of the Iranian people be heard and stop decades of impunity of those who are involved in human rights abuses.\\n\\n8, Ignazio CORRAO, 2021-11-25, EN, The human rights situation in Cameroon, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-25-INT-4-106-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao,  author. – Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, as you know, Cameroon is beset with two violent conflicts and went from peaceful protest to war. The escalation of violence has led to a number of simultaneous political and security challenges and to the high level of instability which the people of Cameroon are now facing. This is very deplorable and frustrating.\\nArmed groups and government forces committed widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial or summary execution and mass killings. This has resulted in 80% of schools in the two Anglophone region being closed or destroyed, and 700\\xa0000 students are denied education. We also see that ethnic tensions are rising, with political speech turned into hate speech, based on ethnicity and gender discrimination, which is taking place in an atmosphere of terror in the region, including targeted attacks on students, teachers, but also journalists and humanitarian workers.\\nAll this is very concerning, and the European Union needs to respond strongly. It is no longer possible to ignore this conflict, and the situation is increasingly deteriorating. We need to mediate for an immediate cease fire, calling on both sides of the conflict to cease purposefully targeting civilians, schools and children, which deprives them of the right to education.\\nIt is also time that we make use of all the financial instruments provided by development aid or other programmes as political leverage, using them to enhance the defence of human rights in a country that is suffering since too long.\\n\\n11, Ignazio CORRAO, 2021-07-06, EN, Situation in Tigray, Ethiopia (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-07-06-INT-2-269-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, I am also very worried about the ongoing situation in Ethiopia. The fresh start we expected with the election has turned into a nightmare. A few days ago, I spoke with the representatives of various Tigrayan communities and I received extremely worrying information concerning human rights. The Ethiopian Government is extensively cracking down on civilians throughout the country. This is the reason why I would not focus only on Tigray, but I would rather highlight the situation regarding the whole of Ethiopia, where several human rights violations have been reported, including arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture, executions and forced displacements. \\nEthiopia needs to see an inclusive national dialogue with all communities, political parties and wider civil society. The commitment and the fundamental role of the European Union lies in humanitarian aid and in promoting inter—regional dialogue and the restoration of security. Let’s act right away!\\n\\n13, Ignazio CORRAO, 2020-02-10, EN, Revision of the guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure - Objection pursuant to Rule 111: Union list of projects of common interest (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-02-10-INT-1-227-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (NI).   – Mr\\xa0President, as one of the 17 MEPs who supported the veto against the 4th PCI list during the last vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), I can unequivocally confirm my intention to vote against this list again.\\nAfter the many nice words and promises I heard on a greener future, it would be interesting to see the results of this objection, because we have to be clear: by allowing this 4th list, we would once again be in favour of a future made of fossil fuel. By allowing this list, we would spend billions of euros in investments that could become obsolete in the not-so-distant future. By allowing this list, we would go against the aspirations and dreams of thousands of young people who, in recent years, have taken to the streets in an awe—inspiring call for a better, greener future. We cannot just ignore that. We can’t answer passion with indifference and inaction. We can’t lose credibility. That’s why I confirm my firm support to this objection and against this 4th list of Projects of Common Interest, which is nothing but a betrayal of the new generation, who want fewer words but real change.\\n\\n14, Ignazio CORRAO, 2020-01-14, EN, Presentation of the programme of activities of the Croatian Presidency (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-14-INT-2-042-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (NI).   – Madam President, I wish good morning to Ms von der Leyen and welcome Mr Plenković back to the European Parliament. \\nMr Plenković, we listened very carefully to your priorities and we endorse your ambitions for there to be a stronger connection to promote the role of the European islands in the clean energy transition. I would really appreciate a general major focus on the Mediterranean islands during this Presidency. You previously mentioned the importance of encouraging digitalisation, investment in research and innovation, with the development of new skills adjusted to jobs. This is one of the most important challenges and opportunities for us in this new green era and in this context, speaking of the green era and therefore of the European Green Deal, why are we not pushing for a real exclusion of green investment from fiscal constraints? We all know, of course, that setting ambitious targets is only part of the job. The real job is transforming those targets into concrete and effective measures that start to change life for European citizens right now. Good luck with your first ever Presidency.\\n\\n15, Ignazio CORRAO, 2019-12-18, EN, Situation of the Uyghur in China (China-cables) (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-18-INT-3-422-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, all this is unacceptable. Despite the continuous call by the international community and the recent publication of documents proving the shameful repression taking place in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, the Chinese Government shows an absolute indifference, and continues to violate human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is absolutely disconcerting that a country like China, which increasingly aspires to become a credible and reliable interlocutor in the global context, must show such a serious violation of fundamental rights. As if that were not enough, China continues its activity of persecution of Uyghurs and other minorities outside the national borders. This must provide us appropriate reflections and countermeasures.\\nThe award which was given to today to Professor Ilham Tohti is an award that goes and not only to him but to every Uyghur citizen who is fighting this madness.\\nAs Europeans, we all must defend with all our strength the rights of the Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region, as in all the countries of the United Nations. The initiative must not be left to the individual Member States but efforts must be shared to be effective.\\n\\n18, Ignazio CORRAO, 2019-12-11, EN, The European Green Deal (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-11-INT-1-039-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (NI).   – Madam President, I have to say there are positive arguments coming from the presentation, but I still have many doubts about the feasibility of your ambitious programmes. We need a huge budget to realise the goals described, and we know that not all Member States are in line with this. As you reported, we have to prevent the tremendous cost of non-actions. We know we don’t have any other options and we do need to invest now. We have dual ambitions: the safeguard of our planet and the safeguard of our labour market. To ensure this, we need to invest in research. We need to simplify the legislation to give access to funds; we need more transparent dialogue with our citizens; and we need to pay special attention to the poorest regions of our continent. During the last plenary we declared a climate and environment emergency. This was a desperate bid to raise awareness. We can’t stand more words. We need concrete actions and we need them now.\\n\\n20, Ignazio CORRAO, 2019-10-23, EN, Climate and ecological emergency (topical debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-10-23-INT-3-278-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, it’s now or never. Climate change is no longer a theoretical debate among scientists, but a reality. If not addressed immediately and resolutely it will have a devastating impact on the planet and on the lives of current and future generations. We all need to understand it is no longer linked to certain political forces or ideologies, but it is a total issue: the biggest risk ever involving all of humanity. \\nI want to be very clear about what I believe should be the concrete proposal of the new European Commission. First of all, it is essential to exclude green investments from deficit calculations in the Stability Pact. Indeed, with the actual EU constraints it is very difficult for Member States to act properly. Second, we must aim to completely phase out investments in fossil fuels. And third, we need to be much more ambitious in terms of targets, aiming for a 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\\nFuture generations will judge us for what we are doing to the planet and those judgments will be decidedly very harsh. We need concrete and urgent actions now.\\n\\n30, Vincenzo SOFO, 2021-03-24, EN, New EU-Africa Strategy (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-24-INT-1-227-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Karlo Ressler,  rapporteur. – Mr President, more than a year has passed since Europe, together with the rest of the world, was struck by one of the worst crisis events in a generation. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of our lives. Many have lost their loved ones, or have not been able to visit their families. Millions of bars, restaurants and businesses had to shut down. Theatres, museums and classrooms continue to stay empty. Europeans have struggled greatly in this period and our hardships, unfortunately, are still not over. Despite the fact that the months ahead of us are unpredictable, we cannot stay idle. We have the responsibility to put forward a vision and adapt to newer circumstances. \\nWith this in mind, I have worked on the guidelines for the next annual budget of the European Union. The programmes, policies and agencies we have built over the years have been facing tremendous new challenges. This is why the next annual EU budget has to be a recovery budget in all its aspects. A recovery fit for all regions, all sectors and all generations. \\nFirst of all, we need to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises receive our full support. SMEs constitute the backbone of the European economy, representing almost 99% of all businesses in Europe and providing around three-quarters of all jobs. Only by protecting that backbone that has been hit particularly hard can we ensure a vibrant economy that boosts investments and tackles unemployment. \\nFurthermore, the next budget should provide all the tools needed to close the digital divide and enable Europe’s economy and public sector to be at the forefront of the accelerated digital transition. \\nThis transition obviously also needs to be in line with the targets set in the European Green Deal, by turning green challenges into investments and opportunities in order to achieve a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient economy. \\nThe COVID-19 crisis has put European health systems under unprecedented stress and exposed shortcomings in production capacities for vaccinations and other essential medical products in the Union. So in order to achieve our budgetary priorities, we will need to ensure a strong European health union based on solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n – Kolegice i kolege, pandemija je još jednom pokazala ogromne zdravstvene i gospodarske razlike između država članica. \\nZato su ključne kohezijske politike koje bi novijim državama članicama trebale omogućiti hvatanje koraka u razvoju, ne zato da bi se same države što bolje pozicionirale nego radi toga kako bi svim europskim građanima osigurali jednake uvjete zdravstvene zaštite i jednake mogućnosti. \\nU tom kontekstu, ne možemo ignorirati niti činjenicu da se cijela Europa, a osobito neki njezini dijelovi suočavaju s negativnim demografskim trendovima. Demografski deficit dugoročni je problem koji zaslužuje sveobuhvatan pristup. Stoga je nužno osvijestiti važnost demografske komponente svih europskih politika pa i u kontekstu članka 174. Ugovora o funkcioniranju Europske unije. \\nPoseban fokus u ovim smjernicama stavili smo na mladu generaciju. Mladi su još jednom posebno pogođeni posljedicama ove krize, uz povećanu nezaposlenost i negativne učinke i na obrazovanje i na mentalno zdravlje. Stoga je potrebno iskoristiti sve mogućnosti financiranja kako bi se povećala uključenost mladih na tržištu rada ali i njihove obiteljske i životne prilike. \\nGospodarski rast neraskidivo je povezan i s unutarnjom sigurnošću, zaštitom naših granica te očuvanjem schengenskog prostora. Stoga mi je posebno drago što smo i u ovim smjernicama naglasili važnost daljnje integracije Schengena što bi nesporno donijelo gospodarske koristi za cijelu Europu. \\nI would like to thank colleagues from all the political groups who have contributed to the guidelines we will be voting on later today and tomorrow. We have an opportunity to achieve a strong, unified and comprehensive position on how we want to shape the next year, through one of the most efficient tools we have. The annual budget, as part of the unprecedented investment packages, has to be a reflection of how best to use the resources at our disposal in order to prepare Europe for the new post-pandemic digital era. \\nThis is an important step in achieving a unified position of Parliament, a clear signal to the Commission and to the Council about our priorities and also a message to our citizens that the EU will continue strengthening all successful programmes and policies in order to ensure a stable and fair recovery.\\n\\n51, Nathalie LOISEAU, 2022-07-06, EN, The UK government’s unilateral introduction of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and respect for international law (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-07-06-INT-3-140-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Nathalie Loiseau,  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, I say to our dear British friends, we live in a time of anxiety: war has come back to Europe, inflation is growing and climate change has come into our lives. At such a time, we need to unite, not to be divided. We need to join forces, not to act unilaterally. We need to honour our commitments, not to breach them. And as always, we need to listen to the people.\\nWhat do people in Northern Ireland have to say? They elected a majority of MLAs who support the Northern Ireland Protocol, provided minor adjustments are made. This is precisely what the EU has offered. We all know there is a landing zone within the protocol. Today, the protocol is not the problem. Look at the numbers. Northern Ireland is faring better than the rest of the UK. There is no shortage, except for two essential goods: predictability and trust. The problem that Northern Ireland is facing, that the UK is facing, has a name. It is not the protocol. The name of the problem is Brexit and the type of Brexit which was chosen by the current British Government.\\n\\n106, Nathalie LOISEAU, 2020-01-29, EN, Withdrawal Agreement of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-29-INT-1-079-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Nathalie Loiseau,  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, for once, I will make an exception. Today is an exceptional moment and I will speak in English because I want to speak to our British friends. To all of you, I will say that we will miss you. The EU will not be the same without you. My deep feeling is that there is no good Brexit. Although I support the Withdrawal Agreement, I’m still convinced that we are better off together than we will be apart from one another.\\nTo all our Lib\\xa0Dem colleagues, I want to express my deep friendship, emotion and admiration. They fought for Europe against all odds. They were a tremendous added value to the work of this Parliament and they remain part of the Renew Europe family.\\nTo the British citizens living in the EU, to the European citizens living in the UK, I want to assure you: we won’t let you down. This Parliament is the voice of the citizens, and we will make sure that citizens’ rights are fully respected.\\nTo the Brexiteers, I could say ‘no hard feelings’. You have achieved your objective. You enter a new phase – the most difficult one – and you will have no one to blame for the future of your country, especially not Brussels. You are in charge. But trust me, if some of you think that the next phase is the weakening of the EU, we will prove you dead wrong. We will renew Europe, make it better, make it stronger, learn the lessons from Brexit. Brexit is a sad and exceptional moment and will remain both.\\n\\n1, Marco CAMPOMENOSI, 2023-10-18, EN, Fighting disinformation and dissemination of illegal content in the context of the Digital Services Act and in times of conflict (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-18-INT-3-365-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Marco Campomenosi (ID).   – Mr President, I’m quite shocked about the support that this Parliament has given to the European Commission because honestly, right of speech should be something on which you should be more attentive.\\nLess than one year ago, this Chamber approved the Digital Services Act, and we are already witnessing the dangers of arbitrary enforcement of its policy. Of course, the aims are agreed by all of us, but if you are sincere, dear Commissioner, you should know very well how complicated it is to reach these aims.\\nIn the dramatic clashes between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli Government, Ministers and army are using social media such as X, for example, to share information, documents and press releases. Both sides of the conflict are doing that. Social media are not the holders of a truth, but a mirror of the war, reflecting what is happening. Our role should not be to say what is good or bad, what is fake or true. In particular, it has just happened during the last terrorist attacks in Brussels. We have seen all of this.\\nBut regarding the activity of social media, because this is particularly facing against X, X is the only platform which has open source algorithms, which is public access and which allows journalists to independently verify the news. It is a model of transparency in that way.\\n‘Freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach’ is a principle that they use, and which is deleting hateful content. Community rules, one notes, are working quite well, and you did not consider the fact that they deleted a lot of illegal content on child pornography and violence against children. You did not mention what happened with the so-called Twitter files, what has been done in the past against content which was not illegal, but which was not liked by the shareholders of the social media owners. \\nThis is the risk. The risk is that the DSA will cause the deletion of legitimate content and not content which is violating rules. So I am afraid citizens are not enough informed, because traditional media are playing a game because they believe that they will have an advantage.\\n\\n1, François-Xavier BELLAMY, 2023-11-22, EN, Threat to rule of law as a consequence of the governmental agreement in Spain (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-22-INT-3-224-0000_EN.html, nan\\n0, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-11-08, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-08-INT-1-036-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, dear colleagues, the various proposals that have been made by the different political groups mirror the gravity of the situation in the Middle East and this Parliament’s strong engagement to contribute to putting an end to violence and to the suffering of innocent civilians in the region.\\nAnd in light of our responsibility as the European Union’s Parliament, it is of crucial importance that our House stands united in this commitment. So, in this spirit, I move a joint proposal on behalf of the EPP, S&D and Renew Groups to add a debate under the title ‘The humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the need for a humanitarian pause’ on the plenary agenda, which could take place this afternoon jointly with our debate on the outcome of the European Council meeting without a resolution. So I hope that a large majority of this Parliament of this House will support this compromise.\\n\\n1, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-11-08, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-08-INT-1-057-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D). – Madam President, dear colleagues, given the statements made yesterday by Commissioner Hahn in the BUDG and CONT committees, on behalf of the S&D Group I would like to withdraw our request for a debate on ‘the continuing threat to the rule of law, the independence of justice and the non-fulfilment of conditionality for EU funding in Hungary’, but, however, given the recent media reports, we would like to stress the need to remain vigilant and keep up the pressure on the European Commission not to release any funds for Hungary, and we will therefore ask for this debate again for the November II plenary session.\\n\\n3, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-10-02, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-02-INT-1-041-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, we absolutely believe that water management is a crucial topic, but we really would like to address this subject also with a debate with a larger, all-encompassing title, including on the impact on agriculture and nature. And so we would propose a broader title: the Council and Commission statements on responsible water management, nature restoration and agriculture.\\nHowever, we know that there are some other political groups that would like to have more time to discuss and to have a debate. And so in the spirit of compromise, we suggest that the debate be moved to the October II plenary session.\\n\\n7, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-06-14, EN, Preparation of the European Council meeting of 29-30 June 2023, in particular in the light of recent steps towards concluding the Migration Pact (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-14-INT-3-023-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr President, dear Minister, dear Commissioner, let us give the state. What is the state? So having unblocked the Migration Pact is a positive fact. But we are only at the beginning and we really hope to improve the text. \\nFirst, the obsession with repatriations everywhere. It seems that the most important thing is to send the migrants back, to push them back as if they were parcel post packages, even in countries of transit, when we know very well that it is not easy at all to make reliable deals with those states. So this risks to be a bluff. \\nSecond, the idea of outsourcing, again by giving money migration policies to external states. Tunisia, this time, an authoritarian state with an autocratic president who arrests a journalists, who represses the opposition, who carries out violent persecutions of black Africans. This is simply nonsense. \\nIt is clear that we cannot welcome everyone and for this reason we need the mandatory solidarity among Member States, not voluntary relocation or EUR\\xa020\\xa0000 for migrants, which is pretty disgusting. Luckily, the money will go to an outside fund. So let us start the negotiations with responsibility and pragmatism. Let us hope to improve the text. \\n\\n8, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-06-12, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-12-INT-1-040-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, actually, we are in favour of the compromise suggested by the EPP because the title is sufficiently broad, and also because we think that we have to defend the role of the European Parliament in the negotiations that will start soon. So we think that there is a broad title, and this allows us to begin the negotiations and to try to find a good compromise also on our part.\\n\\n13, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-03-29, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-29-INT-1-059-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Actually, how do you dare to ask for a debate on the rule of law in Spain when you know the only problem with that is that you are blocking the renewal of the General Council of the Judiciary after four years.\\nSo really, this is really anti-democratic and outrageous, colleagues.\\n\\n15, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-02-02, EN, Improving working conditions in platform work (A9-0301/2022 - Elisabetta Gualmini)  (vote), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-02-INT-2-095-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  rapporteur. – Mr President, dear colleagues, today we vote for the mandate of the report on platform work to the trilogue. I’m asking you to vote in favour of this report, which is a very balanced and innovative text. I thank all the shadow rapporteurs because they have contributed to improve the text. \\nI would like to immediately correct the political narrative which is going on and on. No later than yesterday I got an email from Bolt saying that we would introduce a general automatic reclassification of all platform workers. This is simply not true, and even impossible legally and technically. \\nWe are not against self—employment. If you are genuinely self-employed that is absolutely okay. We are not against job creation and innovation. But if you are bogus self—employed and, on the contrary, you are a slave of the algorithm, then you have to have your rights recognised as an employee. That is the point! \\nWe have reached three goals: we defend the workers; we defend good employers and fair competition; and we are promoting the human use of the algorithm. We do not want machines governing the labour market. Never again should it happen that a young rider like Sebastian Galassi dies in a car accident and then is fired after he dies. This is a shame. This is a shame. \\nI ask you to support this text, to support social justice, which is the glue for democracy. I ask you not to disappoint the millions of workers who are waiting outside, and I ask you not to surrender to multimillionaires and powerful lobbies who try to interfere with our democratic process. Really, the conditions of workers are not an issue of right and left. It is an issue of dignity. That is why I ask you to vote in favour of this report, because this is what it is in play: social justice! On va écrire une très belle page de l’histoire européenne!\\n\\n16, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2023-02-01, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-01-INT-1-026-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, actually, we are not against the topic itself, but for the sake of compromise we do suggest eventually to leave the debate in this mini—plenary with no resolution, and with a changed title that is ‘Commission statement on anarchist terrorist actions and violent extremism in Europe’. \\nI can explain why. It is because we think that anarchism is anarchism. It is not left or right. If you are an anarchist, you are not left or right; you are an anarchist against the institutional order. This is our proposal.\\n\\n18, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2022-12-14, EN, Preparation of the European Council meeting of 15 December 2022 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-14-INT-3-023-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr President, dear Minister, dear Commissioner, dear President of the European Commission, we are at the end of 2022 and we can say that it has also been an annus horribilis because we face a triple attack on democracy: an attack on democracy by Russia with the criminal invasion of Ukraine; an attack on our economy, our single market with the unacceptable blackmail on gas; and then – I do not want to escape – an attack on the democratic functioning and reputation of this institution by unimaginable criminal corruption. \\nBut, at the same time, we have stood up and reached outstanding results. We have a more social Europe, a Europe for health, REPowerEU, finally the freezing of resources for Orbán and his despotic regime. So I really hope that the Council tomorrow will go on with the same determination, also by envisaging a revision of the MFF in the summer in the name of a permanent instrument of public support for people and for companies which are struggling with inflation. \\nI think that we will get stronger if we do this together.

What we have done with the common debt, SURE and Next Gen has been revolutionary. \\nNow, on gas and energy, we really have the same challenge and we cannot take the luxury of time. So we need again a stronger Europe for at least three things: a cap on gas; a centralised purchasing agency for gas; social investments for families and companies not able to pay their bills. \\nBut for all that we need a strong Europe, a stronger Europe. I am very tired of listening to anti—European, extreme right parties that are now asking for European money, European assistance, European aid. Where were you when we spoke about strengthening the competences of our European institutions? You always said ‘no’. So now we need a united Europe, a Europe that delivers. We have to decide. We can do things if we are united – and please do tell the truth! \\n\\n22, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2022-10-18, EN, General budget of the European Union for the financial year 2023 - all sections (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-18-INT-2-191-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr\\xa0President, the general EU budget for 2023 is a powerful political tool. There is a lot of politics inside, not only economics. In times of skyrocketing inflation and economic recession, politics has to deliver. If politics does not deliver, we will have explosive populist upsurges, anti-system protests and nationalist outcries.\\nDuring the pandemic, we were able to basically double the budget of the EU: with Next Generation EU, SURE, REACT-EU, we got another EUR\\xa01\\xa0000\\xa0billion – exactly like the multiannual financial framework. We were kind of magic. Now we have a similar challenge with the energy crisis.\\nIncreasing resources for Erasmus+, the Just Transition, is good news, but it is not enough. We need fresh money coming from new own resources to provide on-the-spot responses to gas deprivation and energy prices. We cannot lose the credit we had during the pandemic. We cannot lose the battle against inequalities and social despair. We cannot lose face in front of our people’s expectations. We simply cannot.\\n\\n23, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2022-09-13, EN, Adequate minimum wages in the European Union (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-09-13-INT-2-139-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr President, dear Commissioner, what we are voting on tomorrow, dear friends, is simply a revolution – a revolution in the name of social justice, dignity and decency for workers. Today, inflation is skyrocketing. The purchasing power of families is falling down and social tensions are exploding. A directive on minimum wages is precisely what we need. Europe has come first, and now in each country, salaries must be adequate to the costs of living. We recognise the importance of the most representative of trade unions, and we encourage Member States to increase the coverage of collective bargaining.\\nThis is a historic moment. We believe that social rights are more important than the ups and downs of the economy. We believe that the living conditions of millions of workers are more important than partisan interests. And we believe that the younger workers, the most precarious ones, their hopes have to be at the centre of our political action. This is not high politics. This is practical problem solving. It is our concrete step toward a fairer and social Europe.\\n\\n25, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2022-05-03, EN, Impact of Russian illegal war of aggression against Ukraine on the EU transport and tourism sectors (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-03-INT-2-367-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr\\xa0President, among the devastating effects of Russia’s criminal aggression against Ukraine, there are those on tourism – which accounts for 10% of GDP in Europe – a sector which has already suffered a lot during the pandemic.\\nWe are facing naturally a loss of Russian and Ukrainian tourists all over Europe, and the costs of energy, foodstuff and fuel are growing fast. An explosive mix. We ask for financial assistance for big and small touristic companies within the internal market programme, together with a full crisis management action plan.\\nPutin has invaded a peaceful country in mainland Europe. This is crystal clear. We have to do our part and support the Ukrainian people in the right to choose their own destiny. Why should a country surrender to the arrogance of a despotic leader? Why should a country submit to the invaders’ will?\\nPutin will respond for his crimes in front of the history, but for now, we have to work for peace. And we have to relieve the most damaging humanitarian, economic and social effects of war, united as ever.\\n\\n26, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2022-03-09, EN, A new EU strategic framework on health and safety at work post 2020 (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-262-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr\\xa0President, if truth be told, we should not die from work. We should not get sick from work. We should not risk burnout because of work. The revision of the European strategy on health and safety at work after the pandemic is totally necessary. \\nIn Italy, in 2021, one hundred people died at work each month; 10% of these were women. Even two young people, Giuseppe and Lorenzo, aged 16 and 18, recently died during their internship. Non-fatal accidents are also increasing, and risks and serious illnesses, stress, psychological disorders and cancer are growing and growing. The COVID pandemic has worsened the phenomenon. In a labour market which is changing a lot, old jobs are disappearing and new jobs, often precarious, unpaid, discontinuous, are spreading. \\nWe have advanced the legislation in Europe on health and safety. Now we have to connect the dots with the transformation of the labour market after the pandemic, not to mention the consequences of this cynical and criminal Russian aggression of Ukraine, with refugees who will have to work in European countries in decent and regular conditions. \\nPlatform workers, writers, remote workers. No big deal. But are we sure that smart working is really smart when you have to balance kids and work? The right to disconnect has to be part and parcel of remote working.\\nWe are now voting for a ‘vision zero’ approach for no more work-related deaths by 2030. This is a huge goal. But, at the end of the day, we have to transform work into what it has to be: good and rewarding. Because work gives you dignity. It gives you perspective. It gives you confidence, self-esteem, and it gives you imagination. This is what we are going to fight for forever, we as socialists and democrats, for decent and healthy work everywhere and for everyone. \\n\\n27, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2021-10-19, EN, General budget of the European Union for the financial year 2022 - all sections (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-19-INT-2-197-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam President, the 2020 budget is the first after the humongous financial effort of Next Generation EU. We are talking about the EUR 170 billion for the next year. We have asked for more resources compared to the Commission, overall EUR 4 billion more. \\nThe programmes for which we have asked for an increase range from Erasmus+ to the Child Guarantee, but here I would like to mention the COVAX programme, one which we speak too little about. Its goal is to deliver vaccines to low income countries all over the world. \\nWe need the EUR 1 billion more in order to reach the 500 million doses announced by von der Leyen. There can be no talk of getting out of the pandemic if it is only us who manage to get out. We cannot think about returning to normal life if it is only us who save ourselves. We cannot think that the right to a healthy life is only for the few and not for the many. \\nWe have learned that what solidarity means, and now we just have to spread the lesson.\\n\\n29, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2021-09-13, EN, Fair working conditions, rights and social protection for platform workers - New forms of employment linked to digital development (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-09-13-INT-1-085-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, platform workers represent maybe the newest form of work of the new millennium. Their numbers have increased with no bounds. Let me say that we are not afraid of innovations. We are not afraid of these disturbing and dystonic times in which you click a button and a pizza meravigliosa arrives directly in your kitchen. We are not afraid even of flexibility – if it is a good thing. \\nBut innovations and transformations in the labour market have to move forward with social protection – the safeguarding of the dignity and safety of workers. Social rights are, at the very end of the day, human rights. \\nWe have been ambitious here. There is a three—step revolution going on. The rebuttable presumption of the employment relationship – if you have an obligation as an employee, you must have a right as an employee. There is no third way. \\nWe have put the burden and charge of solving eventual court conflicts between a platform and workers on the shoulders of platforms, of employers. \\nFinally, transparency and clear information coming from algorithms. We do not want to see any more shameful salaries in what we call a ‘democratic Europe’. We don’t want to see new forms of slavery in what we call a ‘social Europe’. We don’t want to see forms of labour force exploitation and abuse in what we call a ‘fair Europe’. \\nWe do not ask much. We ask simply for a good balance between rights and duties, between economic growth and social compensation. We ask to build a new social, progressive, compassionate Europe.\\n\\n30, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2021-04-27, EN, European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) 2021-2027 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-04-27-INT-2-204-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam\\xa0President, there is good news about the revision of the European Globalisation Fund. At least two items: firstly, the use of the EGF has been expanded for all collective dismissals, to include also medium-sized companies with up to 200\\xa0employees and no longer 500; second, child allowance. Workers with children will receive funds to help them with their parental duties while coping with their unemployment situation. If there is an unemployed mum who is struggling to survive somewhere in Europe that has to matter to us. \\nWe are facing a dramatic crisis in the labour market. Millions of women and men have lost their jobs and it won’t be laws or regulations that will create new jobs and opportunities. It won’t be an enlightened leader who will create jobs and opportunities. It won’t be some reiteration of past and pre-defined solutions that will create jobs and opportunities. It will be concrete measures and resources, actions and not words. This is what Europe should be about. This is what social Europe means. We share our faith in this new vision of Europe.\\n\\n31, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2021-03-24, EN, System of own resources of the European Union – Own resource based on non-recycled plastic packaging waste and certain aspects of the GNI-based own resource – Collection of own resources accruing from value added tax (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-24-INT-1-094-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr\\xa0President, we’ve been waiting for the revision of the own resources system since 1988. And after more than 30\\xa0years, we are close to a historic turning point by approving tomorrow the updating of the implementing legislation regarding new own resources.\\nFinally, the European budget will become more autonomous, more transparent and stronger. We have a precise roadmap for the introduction of new own resources which won’t touch the pockets of our citizens but which will hit polluting companies, web-multinationals and fiscal free-riders more generally. I’m talking about the digital tax and the carbon border levy, to name but a few.\\nBut today it is less about the budget revenue side, and more about what it means to belong to a fiscally stronger European Union; it is less about technicalities and more about political will and political challenges.\\nTo have a sound and responsible budgetary policy means, in the first place, to have the possibility to pay back the costs of the Next Generation EU that needs to be able to support the giant mobilisation of resources which will help citizens and companies to stand up again after a dramatic outbreak.\\nIt means to give hope and faith to the young generations who are completely lost in the middle of this never-ending pandemic, and it means to care for the most vulnerable people who need protection and solid welfare services, not isolation.\\nOur pride is based on the spirit and the sense of a community, the European Community. And communities do work if we have a fair and good balance between the promises we make and the financial resources we collect in order to have these promises fulfilled. It is time to accomplish, to get things done – no time is left. \\n\\n32, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2021-03-09, EN, InvestEU programme (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-09-INT-2-049-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Bas Eickhout (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr\\xa0Fernandes and Ms\\xa0Tinagli, for their excellent work on the InvestEU programme, and I do think that these negotiations show once more how difficult it is to get serious investment programmes with the Council. Sorry to see that also the Council is not present today, to be very honest, because it still seems a problem for the Council to realise that there is a huge investment gap in Europe and that the only way to address that is by a strategic programme being coordinated at the European level and make sure that we are investing as European countries together into a strategic direction where we think Europe should go. And that should be the primary discussion in the Council, as it is also here in the Parliament.\\nOf course, the Parliament fought hard and has made some improvements, but to be very honest, some people said that this is a paradigm shift. Sorry to say that it’s not yet, since there is too much resistance in the Council – and also, I dare to say, sorry, Commissioner, you come up with good proposals, but the moment the Council is weakening it, you very quickly sideline with the Council to give up on your demands. And I think that really should change. We really should fight together on a strategic investment programme, not only on public finance, like on the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), but also on mobilising private investment through the InvestEU programme, the core of which is now there, but now, of course, we have to look at how it’s going to be implemented. And there, we need to really align the implementation of InvestEU together with what we have agreed in the RRF. That means on financing, on climate, that we use the same climate tracking methodology, but that we also use the same approach to make sure that none of the euros is doing any significant harm to our strategic goals of Europe. And I think that is absolutely crucial to have in place.\\nMy last point, and this is for a future agenda and very important, I think, as well, is there is still a tool that has not been touched upon yet, and that is state aid. Every national Member State is giving a huge amount of state aid. We have to make sure that all that money is going in the same direction and is supporting for the same targets. We know it’s being reviewed now, but until now, we don’t hear the same level of ambition to really make sure that those state aid rules are also going into the same direction that we really can, as Europe, deliver on our strategic targets of digitalisation and the Green Deal.\\n\\n33, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2021-01-20, EN, Decent and affordable housing for all (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-01-20-INT-3-251-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr President, housing is the first and most important among social rights, from which all the others derive.\\nIf you have a roof over your head you can develop social relationships, create a family and raise children, cut down your feelings of insecurity and distress. In Europe, 80 million citizens are unable to pay the costs of their houses and the ranks of the homeless have grown by 70% in the last a decade.\\nWe now have to build up a real European plan on housing, based on sustainability. Fortunately a wind of change is blowing through Europe, since Europe is now able to show what solidarity means in front of the big suffering of the people because of the pandemic. So a good society is the one in which the minimum expectations of each of us are fulfilled. We can’t be indifferent to those who sleep in the streets. We can’t be indifferent to those who simply need to build up a future.\\nI hope that this House, our House, will strongly support this dossier.\\n\\n34, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2020-12-16, EN, Conclusions of the European Council meeting of 10-11 December 2020 – MFF, Rule of Law Conditionality and Own Resources – Council regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 – Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources – Regulation on the protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-12-16-INT-3-032-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam\\xa0President, today it is the time of pride.\\nWe are at the end of the most dramatic year in the history of the European Union and the pandemic is still not over. Yes, people are still suffering a lot and some of them are even dying, but we have done our job, and we have to claim this and tell this with all our voice and our passion.\\nToday we can say we have finally closed up the agreement on the whole financial strategy, the Recovery Fund, the MFF, the revision of own resources and together with the other programmes we can count almost EUR 2 400 billion for fighting the crisis. \\nWe have to be proud of this European renaissance. We have to be proud of this huge mobilisation of resources never before put in place for our citizens, and we have to be proud to have strengthened the rule of law. No relativism on democratic values is acceptable. \\nWe have done our job and it is a good job. We have been united, notwithstanding our work differences. We have been determined, not withstanding our uncertainties. We have been efficient, notwithstanding what were long and sometimes incomprehensible procedures. We have been ambitious, notwithstanding our fears. \\nI am on my first mandate. I am proud of having entered the European institutions in such a moment of change and historic commitment and for those who still do not believe in Europe, who think that alone we could face dramatic challenges, let them come to Brussels.\\nFor those who think that Europe is only a giant of hype and bureaucracy, very far from people, let them come to Brussels.\\nFor those who have to use a credit card before entering into a hospital, let them come to Brussels.\\nDear colleagues, we have done a huge and terrific job. We just have to go on. \\n\\n35, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2020-11-25, EN, Preparation of the European Council meeting of 10-11 December 2020 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-11-25-INT-3-067-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam President, it’s really time to close up the agreement on the budget, the Recovery Fund and own resources. It is not acceptable that countries like Hungary and Poland, which have democracy disregard, which have minorities in disregard, which have women and independent media in disregard, keep on blocking everything. \\nWe as MPs have to relaunch the conference on the future of Europe and to revise the unanimity rule and real paralysis in decision—making. We can’t be hostages of veto points and national selfishness. We can’t be hostages of despotic leaders and we can’t rely every time on rescue at the last by Angela Merkel, like kids with their mummy.\\nChers amis, des millions de citoyens sont en train d’attendre des réponses solides, concrètes et visionnaires. Il ne s’agit pas de nos petites carrières, il s’agit de donner des certitudes et il s’agit de l’avenir de nos jeunes, de la lutte pour la démocratie, le climat et les droits.\\n\\n39, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2020-02-12, EN, Preparation of the Extraordinary European Council Meeting of 20 February 2020 on the Multiannual Financial Framework (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-02-12-INT-3-047-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam\\xa0President, it is really time to stand up and act and the Multiannual Financial Framework is really the last opportunity we have to change Europe for the next seven years and to shock our European citizens – yes, to shock them, to shock every single person in the EU – because we have to increase the total amount of available resources, not renounce it to 1.3 of GNI in order for our promises to become true: a Green New Deal, the additional unemployment benefit and the Child Guarantee of six billion. No one dares to take away from children what are their basic rights – food, health and education – and the traditional mainstream European programmes have to be financed as well, so we cannot deal with a war between the poor – agricultural policies, cohesion policies, Erasmus, have to be financed as well. And on the revenue side, let us think also of a digital tax and the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax for multinationals. \\nOn this side of the Hemicycle we believe in more Europe and not less. We believe in more public investments and not in cutting down and downsizing. We believe in a good society which is a society for the many and not for the few, so the European Council has to listen to our voice.\\n\\n40, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2020-01-13, EN, Gender pay gap (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-13-INT-1-188-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam\\xa0President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that to close the gender pay gap is not a symbol, but a way to restore social justice in our democracies.\\nNot only is there the pay gap, but women are also victims of glass ceilings since they are not often promoted at the top level of their career. Women are victims of family duties and tasks since they are often the only caregiver in the house. Women are victims of gender bias and often not considered adequate enough. Women are also victims of violence, and more than 30% have experienced one form of violence in their lives.\\nSo this is the real fight, a fight for decency, for justice and for change. We have to fight for a day on which women will be fully equal to men, on which they will be fully aware of their value and their potential, and on which no more women will have to choose between a child and a job.\\nSo please let us close the pay gap as soon as possible within the next three months. You have to promise us: ‘you’re not alone, we are with you and we will never give up’.\\n\\n43, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2019-11-26, EN, 2020 budgetary procedure: joint text (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-26-INT-2-225-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Mr\\xa0President, I do not think it is the case that tomorrow we will vote on the 2020 budget, together with the new Commission, because maybe tomorrow – and I hope so – a new political phase is going to start. The 2020 budget, which is actually the largest one of the last MFF, and for which I thank the whole conciliation team, is actually a transition budget. It projects us into the future, because the real challenge is going to be the new MFF. We have to decide whether we want to be ambitious or shy, and whether we would like to work in an expansive – though responsible – way, maybe facing a new economic crisis, or if we want to go on with business as usual. \\nTwo things are very clear. We need new own resources to finance the goals we want to achieve, and both are connected to climate change and to the internal market. We also need a new MFF centred on well—rooted European policies, like cohesion policy and agricultural policy, but also linked to the new policies like, for instance, the implementation of the social pillar. Budgetary policies are, as you know, at the core of political institutions. They represent the way we respond to citizens, but they also represent the way in which we can show what we do or do not do. Numbers do not lie. So I hope we will be very courageous. \\n\\n48, Elisabetta GUALMINI, 2019-09-18, EN, Presentation by the Council of its position on the draft general budget - 2020 financial year (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-09-18-INT-3-276-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Elisabetta Gualmini (S&D).   – Madam\\xa0President, budget decisions are the core of political action. The allocation of financial resources is not a technical and bureaucratic exercise, but it is the way the European Union answers the needs and requirements of the 500\\xa0million EU citizens. \\nWe, as the European Parliament, have to be very ambitious. We do not have to be afraid, in a period of crisis, of flying high – the more the economic crises throw us down, the more we have to be high-flyers. We do not only have to ask to restore the budget initially proposed by the Commission, but we have to increase it. The proposal made by the S&D Group of EUR\\xa03.4 billion is absolutely acceptable. In particular, all the financial targets related to climate change have to be strongly defended and promoted in the 2020 budget. Secondly, the Youth Guarantee has to be strengthened and permanently included in the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). Thirdly, neighbourhood policies, especially in the Mediterranean area, are fundamental and have to be reaffirmed in order to keep on with our values of solidarity and inclusion. \\nAs shadow rapporteur, I have dealt with the European agencies, and it is important to increase both the funding and the staff of the agencies whose action positively affects environmental policies, labour policies and migration policies. We are facing a crossroads. Europe must be a green and social Europe, or nothing at all. Please do not let us miss this opportunity.\\n\\n1, Irene TINAGLI, 2023-05-09, EN, Revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-09-INT-2-022-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, a good economic governance must have two characteristics – ambition and credibility – and credibility does not rhyme necessarily with the severity as many claim. Credibility is measured by the economic, social and political sustainability of those rules. And if rules are not sustainable over time, governance is not credible. So the old governance was perhaps ambitious, but not particularly credible – it hasn’t proved that over time.\\nThe review launched by the Commission shall set the right balance between ambition and credibility. The proposals are already moving in the right direction, but frankly, I believe that something more needs to be done to guarantee an adequate level of public investment, because these investments are key to growth in private investments as well, and these will ensure the digital, environmental and social transition challenges that we have ahead of us and this is what really we need to do to meet our citizens’ expectations. \\nSo, more investments today means more growth, more jobs for tomorrow and in the end, that’s what we are called to deliver. This is what citizens expect from us. This is how we can be credible.\\n\\n2, Irene TINAGLI, 2023-03-15, EN, Failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the implications for financial stability in Europe (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-15-INT-3-176-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Madam President, thank you Commissioner for being with us for this important debate. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank teaches us some lessons. Commissioner has already outlined several of them, but I want to stress two of them in particular. \\nThe first is that an ambitious prudential regulation is a necessary condition not only for having healthy and solid banks, but also for preventing financial dominance. The second lesson is that either there is a fully fledged bank crisis management framework able to deal with both idiosyncratic and systemic crises or, in the end, only citizens pay the bailout bill.\\nIn the EU, we were pretty good on the first point – although the work has yet to be completed and I agree with most of the things that our rapporteur Fernández said on the Basel III negotiations – but momentum was lost on the second part, the bank crisis management framework. If we really want to strengthen the banking system and make economic policy truly independent, we have to deliver as soon as possible on one thing: the completion of the banking union. \\n\\n3, Irene TINAGLI, 2023-03-14, EN, European Semester for economic policy coordination 2023 - European Semester for economic policy coordination: Employment and social priorities for 2023 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-14-INT-2-117-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  rapporteur. – Madam President, last year, when we debated the Semester report in this House, war had just broken out in Ukraine. The war had, and is still having, a devastating impact on the Ukrainian population. To a completely different extent it had, and it still having, an impact on us as well. \\nThe EU was one of the most exposed advanced economies to downward risks, given its proximity to Ukraine and also the heavy reliance on energy imports, particularly on gas from Russia. The impact of high energy prices and the subsequent inflation led to the erosion of household purchasing power and industry competitiveness, in particular that of SMEs. \\nSo, on the one hand, we all know that the low and stable inflation rate will be an important condition for long—term sustainable economic growth and so it is important to intervene on inflation. But, on the other hand, we also know that a reduction in aggregate demand, combined with the less favourable financing conditions, which are related, when you have high interest rates, could lead to a sharp decline in investment and therefore in future economic growth. \\nSo investment in renewables and energy efficiency, for example, could also suffer, although these are precisely the investments required to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and structurally limit inflation driven by energy prices. So it’s quite a complicated conundrum. \\nThese deteriorating economic conditions have increased the vulnerabilities and risks. The rising mortgage rates and the deterioration in debt servicing capacity resulting from the decline in real income of households may cause further distress for families and for financial markets in general. So against this background, we need to act.\\nIn our public debate, we always recall that the primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability, of course. But we should also recall that the aim of the Union as a whole should be to dampen the impact of current turbulences on the real economy and to minimise future risks, thereby defending the well-being of our citizens and preserving our production structure and the international competitiveness of our companies, as well as decent working conditions for our workers. \\nSo in this regard, we need adequate and coordinated fiscal, structural and regulatory policies that complement the ECB’s monetary policy actions in order to support household incomes and provide targeted and temporary support to companies suffering from supply bottlenecks and high energy costs. The policy leeway created by the activation of the general escape clause was very important and was determinant in strengthening Member States’ economic and social resilience, both during the COVID pandemic and also in the last year after the war started. \\nThe Commission released last week the fiscal policy guidance for 2024. However, we need more clarity as regards the medium and long term. This is why we call in this report for an urgent review of the EU fiscal framework, preferably to be completed prior to the deactivation of the general escape clause. The Commission’s communication of last November is an important step in the right direction. It addressed most of the concerns to emerge in the last years in the public debate, in particular as regards the simplification of the framework and the more tailor—made governance. The revised regulatory framework should allow Member States to have sufficient leeway to deliver decisive crisis resolution measures when they are needed and should preserve the flexibility already in—built in the Stability and Growth Pact. \\nOf course, there are some issues that are not addressed in the Commission communication, but which are important. For example, the issue of macroeconomic stabilisation is not properly addressed, and we believe that the Commission should build also on the positive experience we’ve had in the past years, for example with SURE. But most importantly, we hope that there will be a debate and that the Commission, the Council, will consider our contribution to the Semester cycle and the Commission will soon be able to bring forward legislative proposals on the reform of economic governance. \\n\\n4, Irene TINAGLI, 2023-02-15, EN, European Central Bank - annual report 2022 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-15-INT-3-262-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Madam President, recently a Minister of an EU Member State said, complaining, that the ECB is not accountable to anyone except herself. This is simply not true. Not only is this debate proving that is not true, but so do all the practices that we have. The ECB President regularly comes to discuss ECB actions in the ECON\\xa0Committee of this Parliament, and we scrutinise the ECB actions very seriously, very thoroughly. \\nHowever, as President Lagarde recalled, this accountability exercise is largely based on practices, most of which are not explicitly written or codified. But now we are ready to change this, and I’m really happy about it. We’ve been waiting for a long time. Twenty—five years ago, a Parliament report called for an agreement with the soon—to—be—established ECB. For over 20 years, no progress was made. But more recently, in the ECON Committee, during one of these debates, we started to discuss with President Lagarde about this need and we started with her a fruitful dialogue. I’m so pleased that the ECB is now ready to take this step and I want to thank President Lagarde for her openness, her availability. Please let me acknowledge her work. \\nThe independence of the ECB must be preserved but, at the same time, independence and accountability must go hand in hand. This is what we have done, this is what we will do, and this will reinforce citizens’ trust and silence the sceptics.\\n\\n5, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-11-22, EN, Question Time (Commission) - Future legislative reform of the Economic Governance Framework in times of social and economic crisis, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-22-INT-2-217-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – I want to go back on the investment issue and in particular on the national investments. I think this proposal is very positive, very good in a way that tries to find a better balance between the stability and the growth, and investments – national investments – are crucial to that end. The only thing that I wonder, in the legislative proposal that I’m confident will be presented very soon, I think that we will need a little bit more clarification on some aspects of these national investments: how they will be treated, which kind of investments, which conditions. I mean, I would like the Commission to elaborate a little bit more and to share with us some clarification on this matter.\\n\\n6, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-11-22, EN, Question Time (Commission) - Future legislative reform of the Economic Governance Framework in times of social and economic crisis, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-22-INT-2-219-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Let me be a little bit more specific. In the communication of 2015, the Commission provides a clear and specific region for certain investments, you know, that takes into account not only compliance with macroeconomic criteria, but also the type of investment. That’s what I wanted to look into, with particular reference, but of course not limited to co-financed investments that are part of European projects. I think this is an important part. I would like to have clarification. Are you considering proposing something similar in the new governance as well? Because I think in the upcoming years, that would be very, very important and very valuable.\\n\\n7, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-11-09, EN, REPowerEU chapters in recovery and resilience plans (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-09-INT-1-150-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, tomorrow’s vote marks an important step ahead towards addressing some structural problems which are emerging in the current energy crisis by means of investments for new infrastructure, for example, for renewable energy production and for overcoming energy supply distortion. The resources at stake are important: EUR\\xa020 billion in grants and more than EUR\\xa0200 billion in loans that are unused under the RRF. \\nHowever, we asked – and we will keep asking – for more resources, because the challenges of the current energy crisis are much bigger than the resources that are finally allocated. Let’s face it, we all know what is at stake: the competitiveness of our businesses; the fragility of our families and households; energy poverty. \\nSo more resources will be needed. And not only resources, as to address the energy crisis we will need reforms in the energy market – temporary ones and structural ones. We know what we are talking about: a new benchmark for gas prices; a dynamic cap that we’ve been discussing; the decoupling of gas and electricity prices. \\nWe know what we have to do, now it’s time to deliver.\\n\\n8, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-10-18, EN, Keep the bills down: social and economic consequences of the war in Ukraine and the introduction of a windfall tax (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-18-INT-2-057-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, for months, we’ve been saying to people that the rising cost of energy was something limited and temporary. But it’s not been like that. And, let’s face it, it will not be like this in the future. Governments had to intervene massively to support families and businesses and will have to do that again in the future. But it’s not going to be sustainable in the long term, we know that.\\nSo what does it mean? It means that this will affect the competitiveness of our businesses, will affect the single market and bring about fragmentation and will also have spill-overs that will aggravate and accelerate a possible recession all over the European Union.\\nSo we need to intervene very quickly, urgently, on two fronts: one, provide a genuine European instrument to provide support to those countries that don’t have the fiscal space, and also to restore the single market. And then we need an incisive intervention on the energy market – yes, the joint procurement. But we need something more ambitious on the gas price, decoupling gas from energy prices.\\nIf we’re not ambitious now, we will regret it when it will be too late.\\n\\n9, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-06-22, EN, Implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-22-INT-1-193-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Madam President, the reality around us, from the Russian aggression to the turbulence on the energy market, confirmed the genuine need for the Recovery Fund. Many of the decisions that we took during the negotiations, from the inception of the European instrument to avoid internal market fragmentation to fostering the renewables in the energy mix, were forward-looking, and the Parliament largely contributed to it. So I think this is something we need to learn from what we’ve done and be happy about it, but we also believe that further action is needed.\\nFiscal capacity at the European level is currently missing. That’s something that would allow us to cope with external shocks like the Russian aggression, for example. REPowerEU represents a very good opportunity, absolutely. It’s an opportunity to drastically accelerate our energy transition and increase Europe’s energy independence. But its swift deployment is possible thanks to previous decisions taken in terms of budget and own resources. What would happen if we had new crises coming up? We wouldn’t have new tools. We wouldn’t have resources. That’s why I think we need to move forward. We need to complete our economic and monetary union, because when we are united and look forward, we are capable of great things. But we just need the tools.\\n\\n10, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-03-09, EN, European Semester for economic policy coordination: annual sustainable growth survey 2022 – European Semester for economic policy coordination: employment and social aspects in the annual sustainable growth strategy survey 2022 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-024-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  rapporteur. – Madam\\xa0President, when the Commission opened the 2022 Semester cycle last autumn, war in Europe was not even in our worst nightmares. On the contrary, there were many hopes that the Union could leave behind the difficult months of the COVID pandemic and start to face more decisively the digital, environmental and social challenges. When we started to draft this report, we thought – and we still believe – that the Semester is the right tool with which to coordinate all these efforts in order to maximise their effects at Union level.\\nWhen the Semester cycle started, the economic situation we faced was quite positive and expectations were good, although we still started to notice that were some elements that could have jeopardised the strength of the recovery in 2022. First of all, we had problems of labour shortages that have involved many service sectors in the reopening phase, that in the coming months could have affected other sectors, like logistics, transport and activities related\\xa0to\\xa0information\\xa0technologies. Second, we were still dealing with COVID. We were still dealing with the new variants, we were afraid of new waves, and there were low rates of vaccination in some parts of the world and of Europe as well. Last but not least, we started to observe a sharp rise in energy prices and, for this reason, also of the inflation rate. The succession of these elements could of course have led to some slowdown, but with an adequate policy mix and a full coordination of monetary and fiscal policy action, both at the European and national level, we were optimistic and positive that we could preserve the good prospects for 2022.\\nAnd then the war. The war has drastically changed this scenario. The tough but necessary sanctions against Putin’s regime are the right response to his barbaric attack on Ukraine, but we know they will have an important impact on our economies. We are, of course, willing to shoulder these costs. We will. We have to. But we have to be ready. We have to prepare. If the situation in Ukraine does not improve, we could have considerable consequences on the availability of some goods and above all, of course, energy products. This will result in an increase not only of energy prices, but also of the prices of other important commodities that will affect various sectors like agriculture, food industries and others.\\nIn this regard, I see three possible risks that we have to be aware of and prepare to address. The first relates to the ability of the downstream market to absorb price increases. The risk that I see is that this could lead to a slowdown in aggregated demand, delaying the time of recovery or slowing it down compared to what we expected before. The second factor is the possible effect on wage dynamics, which could occur, of course, if the shock were to extend over a longer period of time. This will also have an impact on inflation. The third factor is that a prolonged energy crisis and, in particular, a possible asymmetric effect in energy costs for the Union would also lead to a loss of competitiveness for European industry and also to divergences in the single market. On top of that, a prolonged phase of tension on energy prices would have consequences not only on inflation, as we have seen in the past months, but also on industry costs by influencing the investment decisions of manufacturing companies. Therefore the risk is that we could see a phase of investment postponements or rescheduling. This is possible despite the high level of current demand.\\nSo against this complex and worrisome background, I really think that all policy tools should be used to manage this delicate phase and to do it in the most appropriate, incisive way. First, EU institutions will have to empower EU governments to rise to these epochal challenges. This is why I welcome the European Commission’s willingness to adapt its fiscal guidance for 2023 to the new realities. This is not the time to go back to fiscal rules that were meant for completely different moments. They are not adequate to face the challenge that we have ahead and we need to support Member States in keeping people safe and confident for the future.\\nBut second we also need to put in place an EU response, EU tools, as we did for COVID. We usually say that we have to learn from past mistakes, but sometimes we also have to learn from what worked, from past success. If we look back at how we managed the COVID crisis, if we look back at what worked, the key factors that explain the EU success in managing the consequences of the COVID crisis were putting in place the right policy mix, balancing monetary policy, fiscal policies and effective coordination in the policy actions of Member States, and the introduction of new European tools that were adequate to the challenge that we faced, tools that made us stronger, more united, and that allowed us to go back to a pre-crisis level of growth much faster than anybody would have thought. So let us approach this new phase with the same spirit, and I’m sure we can make it.\\n\\n11, Irene TINAGLI, 2022-02-14, EN, Formal sitting – 20th anniversary of the euro, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-14-INT-1-035-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  Chair the ECON Committee. – Madam President, 20 years is an important anniversary for anyone, but I think that if we look back at all that the euro has been through, well, then we realise how special this anniversary is. \\nAt first, the introduction of the single currency in Europe seemed like a risky bet. Many feared it was too early. Others thought that there were other priorities. There was some fear about it. And later, after the financial crisis, many thought that the euro was at risk and that a restoration of national currencies was upcoming. Well, it turned out quite differently, and not only is the euro still here, but it’s stronger than ever. Other Member States have decided to adopt it, and others will soon be able to do so. \\nThe truth is that the euro has been the key element of the last 20 years of the Union. It has complemented the single market. It has made it easier to trade and travel and live across different countries in the European Union. It has boosted European value chains, strengthening our economies. It has been the prerequisite for preserving the European monetary sovereignty in a globalised world. It has represented the cornerstone of a peaceful Union and a global actor after the end of the Cold War and German reunification. Without the euro, I’m quite sure we would be telling quite different stories.\\nThe success of the euro is not a matter of chance. Its strength, its value and its very existence has constantly been guaranteed and preserved by the European Central Bank. Over the past 20 years, the ECB has been the true guardian of the Union’s currency, and I’m confident that it will continue to play its role even in the coming years of big innovations and changes. We’ve heard about some of those.\\nBut the euro’s success was also the result of a strong political will. The euro was the best investment that we could have made to ensure a stable environment for the new generations. This awareness was the fundamental element that allowed us to overcome even the most difficult moments, and we’ve heard just a few minutes ago about some of those moments. \\nThe euro has definitely brought to us many successes, but we have to also to acknowledge and to recognise that it has not delivered all the gains that it could have delivered in all the Member States and to all the European citizens. And this is partly due to some national issues and partly the result of the fact that the Economic and Monetary Union is still incomplete – as Commissioner Gentiloni just reminded us.\\nSo, the way ahead, therefore, is to identify the changes that are necessary to make our monetary union work for the benefit of everybody. The experience of the euro shows that even the riskiest bets, if supported by political will, can be successful and can mark a great leap forward in the history of our Union.\\n\\n12, Irene TINAGLI, 2021-12-15, EN, State of play of the RRF (Recovery and Resilience Facility) (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-15-INT-3-184-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Madam President, we are really at a crucial stage in the Recovery and Resilience Facility as we are moving from the planning to the implementation. And this is an unprecedented challenge, which will have important consequences for the future. \\nFirst, a successful implementation will mark another leap forward in the integration process of the European Union, and will show even to the most sceptical ones, what it means a united and strong Europe. \\nSecond, the national plans will help not only to support the recovery, but also to accelerate the green transition, the digital transition and the competitiveness of our Union. \\nAnd third, let’s not forget that it will help us building a better and fair Europe. Commissioner Gentiloni, yesterday in the RRF dialogue, reminded us and today as well that of all the plans that have been approved, EUR 127 billion are dedicated to social policies. This is a huge chunk of the financial envelope, and it’s crucial to improve the lives of the European citizens, to build the kind of Europe – closer to the citizens – that we are here for.\\n\\n13, Irene TINAGLI, 2021-11-10, EN, Disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-10-INT-1-133-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, after five years of deadlock in the Council, we finally managed to seal a deal on the public country-by-country reporting, which is a crucial transparency tool. Thanks to the work of this Parliament, big multinationals will be obliged to publicly disclose where they make profits and where they pay their taxes. The agreement also includes the obligation for companies to publish how many full-time employees they have, their turnover and taxes paid, as well as all the profits and losses they have in each country they operate in – in the European Union and in tax havens.\\nThanks to this transparency, citizens will know which companies are freeriding and which are contributing their fair share to society. This is part of a bigger effort that we are leading towards creating a more just and fair society. Along with the international tax agreement, a new wave of tax justice is now on the agenda of the European debate and of the international one, and we will keep pushing and step-by-step we will build a better Union.\\n\\n14, Irene TINAGLI, 2021-10-20, EN, Global Tax Agreements to be endorsed at the G20 Summit in Rome, 30th/31st of October (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-20-INT-3-304-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr President, the first thing I want to express today is a great sense of achievement. One hundred and thirty-six countries have finally reached an agreement to end the deleterious race to the bottom caused by deregulated international fiscal competition. This agreement will help us fight fiscal elusion, fiscal dumping and will provide new resources to many countries that can be used to address social inequalities and to support economic recovery. \\nSomeone says it’s not enough. Yes, many of us would have loved to see a more ambitious agreement. But now we have two choices. We can keep complaining and despise the agreement, or we can acknowledge the enormous effort made, and we can push for a rapid and effective implementation of the agreement in the European Union as soon as possible. \\nWe choose this latter option and we call on all the parties involved at the Commission, the Council and every Member State to take a step forward and to facilitate such fast and strict implementation. Now, more than ever, we need more tax justice. Let’s get started.\\n\\n15, Irene TINAGLI, 2021-05-18, EN, Business Taxation (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-05-18-INT-2-295-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr\\xa0President, we always knew, even before the pandemic, that the international fiscal system is flawed and creates spaces for opportunistic behaviour – elusion, evasion and fraud – that benefit the few at the expense of many others. With thousands of businesses severely hit by the pandemic, we cannot tolerate these distortions any further, and we cannot properly support recovery with a system that allows hundreds of billions of euros in potential tax revenues to be lost because of evasion and fraud. \\nThat’s why we warmly welcome the Commission’s support for a strong global agreement, as well as its commitment to act swiftly on the implementation of such an agreement. In this regard, it is clear to us that all the main elements of the current negotiations need to be maintained, the so-called Pillar\\xa01and Pillar\\xa02. We need to ensure that profits are allocated where the value is created, and at the same time we need to stop a fiscal competition that translates into a deleterious race to the bottom through a minimum effective taxation to multinationals. \\nThere’s another important element that I want to mention in this short timeframe that I have available: the commitment to propose a measure to neutralise the misuse of shell companies. It is a strong clear sign that shows a commitment to fight tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. \\nSo overall we really welcome this communication. We believe it is an important step to move towards a simpler, fairer and more transparent fiscal system and we look forward to working on that.\\n\\n16, Irene TINAGLI, 2021-03-09, EN, InvestEU programme (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-09-INT-2-011-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  rapporteur. – Madam\\xa0President, we are at the end of a great adventure that began in 2018 with the first Commission proposal. It was a long and bumpy journey, but we can now celebrate an important success. I would like to thank the present and past components of the negotiating team in the Parliament, and especially my co—rapporteur, José Manuel Fernandes, for what we’ve done together.\\nIn this term we went through some exciting moments, for example when, in May 2020, the Commission represented the InvestEU proposal with a very ambitious budget, but also through moments of great concern, for example when Member States decided, during the July 2020 European Council, on a very severe cut to the InvestEU budget line, basically making it a marginal and useless programme.\\nWe did not get discouraged. We worked to give a worthy heir to the Juncker Plan and also to create an ambitious programme capable of facing the challenges of our times. Looking at the text of the final agreement that we will vote on today, we can say that our commitment has been rewarded. There are more funds, there are more ambitious environmental targets, and there is more national European synergy, thanks to the possibility for other implementing partners to promote projects.\\nBut our real success has been to place InvestEU at the heart of Next Generation EU. InvestEU is a long—term investment programme with a particular focus on SMEs. Its four windows cover the major objectives that the Union has set for the coming years: sustainability, innovation, research, social infrastructure. InvestEU is a programme that, perhaps more than others, highlights the paradigm shift that has taken place in the Union. The real innovation of Next Generation EU is not just the money made available to Member States. Next Generation EU is much more than that. It is the acknowledgement that there are individual and collective needs that are currently not fully satisfied. The financial crisis of 2008 and the economic crisis caused by the COVID pandemic have shown us that there is a lack of supply of goods and services that are necessary for the well-being of citizens and firms, and bridging this gap is the challenge of our time.\\nInvestEU is one of the responses that the Union has put in place, but InvestEU is not just about resilience: it is a tool for recovery. First of all, Parliament fought hard to create a synergy with the Recovery and Resilience Facility and, thanks to our battle, Member States will now be able to divert up to four percent of their funds from the recovery fund to guarantee investment projects eligible for InvestEU.\\nWe also managed to resurrect a fundamental tool for the recovery that the European Council of July 2020 had basically eliminated: the Solvency Support Instrument. My colleague, Mr Fernandes, has already mentioned that, but I would like to underline the importance of this tool. Now, both the European and the national compartments of InvestEU will be able to provide capital support to small and medium—sized enterprises that got into trouble due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is perhaps the most important result that we, as a Parliament, have achieved. But let me say that, without the strong commitment of Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni during the negotiations, we probably would not have made it. So thank you, Paolo.\\nOur work is not done yet. We still have to scrutinise the delegated acts, in particular the one on investment guidance, and we have to appoint the governance bodies, the advisory board, the steering board and the investment committee. During one of the trilogues of InvestEU, I realised that the majority of the people that were present in the room during the negotiations were women. InvestEU is therefore the result of the work and the effort of many women. So it would be nice if the Commission, the EIB, the implementing partners, but also the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament, kept this in mind when they have to appoint their representatives in these bodies – not because it is a provision in the regulation, but because it’s the right thing to do. So thank you very much everybody.\\n\\n17, Irene TINAGLI, 2021-02-09, EN, Establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-02-09-INT-2-045-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr\\xa0President, the Recovery and Resilience Facility is not only a way to address the effects of the COVID crisis, but a great leap forward towards a closer and deeper union. It complements the action of the European Central Bank and partially overcomes the lack of a common European fiscal capacity for the time being.\\nHowever, we would be wrong to consider this facility as the final destination of our journey. This is just the beginning. Full recovery will require time, energy, commitment and a great sense of responsibility. In order to succeed, new forms of dialogue and interaction, solidarity and mutual understanding are required. Now, more than ever, it’s clear that having a solely national perspective for economic and budgetary measures is not only pretentious, but is short-sighted and inefficient.\\nSo a truly European approach is the only way to foster territorial cohesion, to fight social inequalities, and to support policies dedicated to the next generation of Europeans. As a Parliament, over the next years, we will be vigilant to ensure that the Commission carries out the tasks assigned in appropriate ways so that the facility reaches its objectives, especially in terms of digital and environmental transformation, social impact and the Next Generation policies that we have envisaged for the Union.\\nIt will not be easy. There will be bumps along the road and divisive forces will always be around the corner, and we got a sample from the debate this morning. So I say to my colleagues that we have created a powerful instrument for unity and solidarity. Now it’s our responsibility to make sure that what was conceived to unite us will not end up dividing us.\\n\\n18, Irene TINAGLI, 2020-02-11, EN, European Central Bank - annual report 2018 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-02-11-INT-2-155-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli (S&D).   – Mr\\xa0President, this report to the European Parliament expresses its support for the ECB’s monetary policy and recognises that the measures implemented are consistent with its mandate, and have been decisive in preserving the euro area from deflation and also in contributing to the ongoing economic recovery. I challenge anyone to prove that today we’d be better off had we adopted different policies.\\nBut many of the challenges we face today are new and they require further innovation in the way monetary policy is conducted. Madame Lagarde, you mentioned many of those: climate change, digitalisation... I would also add economic inequalities, especially in certain areas. All of these factors will have a significant structural impact on the way the economy works. They will affect key economic variables, financial stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy.\\nTo fulfil its mandate of delivering price stability, the ECB will better understand how the changing climate, technological innovation and economic inequalities will affect the behaviour of households, firms and financial institutions. The ECB has the analytical capacity and resources to push the frontier of knowledge on these issues and we are definitely keen to do our part. \\n\\n19, Irene TINAGLI, 2020-01-16, EN, Institutions and bodies in the Economic and Monetary Union: Preventing post-public employment conflicts of interest (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-16-INT-4-008-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  author. – Madam\\xa0President, on 17 September 2019, Mr\\xa0Adam Farkas announced his resignation from his position as Executive Director of the European Banking Authority (EBA), which will be effective on 31\\xa0January\\xa02020 to become, starting on 1\\xa0February 2020, the CEO of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a well-known lobbying company that, according to its website, is the voice of Europe’s wholesale financial services.\\nLet me remind you what the EBA’s responsibilities are: the EBA is responsible for supervising the EU’s banking sector and for setting technical standards implementing key financial regulations. This makes the EBA a fundamental institution that regulates and supervises the financial sector. It also, of course, makes it a constant lobbying target for the industry. AFME, like other stakeholders, appears to have permanent interactions with the EBA.\\nIn compliance with the staff regulations and ethical rules, the EBA’s Board of Supervisors has taken a decision to impose fairly light restrictions on its Executive Director, both while in service at the EBA and after leaving the EBA. However, the restrictions on Mr Farkas’s future employment do not seem either realistic or enforceable. Unless Mr\\xa0Farkas simply becomes AFME’s poster boy, I cannot really find a single topic that AFME covers that does not fall within the remit of the EBA and does not relate to the work of Mr\\xa0Farkas.\\nMoreover, it is not clear to me who will monitor the effective application of these restrictions, in particular the one that provides that he cannot engage in lobbying or advocacy of the EBA or have professional contacts with EBA staff for 24 months after leaving the Authority. How are we going to enforce that or control that? Who’s going to do that? So, for this reason, we call for a review of this decision by the EBA Board of Supervisors. Sadly, Mr\\xa0Farkas’ is not the first case, and will probably not be the last, of a post—public employment job in the private sector that poses evident problems of conflicts of interest, but we absolutely must act to ensure that this is the last. I really hope that this is the last. \\nRevolving doors, where one jumps from public institutions to top positions in the private sector, from regulators to regulated, or from supervisors to supervised, and vice versa unfortunately not only undermine the credibility of the individual engaging in such behaviour, but undermine the credibility of the whole institution and, more generally, the trust that citizens have in public bodies, and the trust that citizens have in public institutions is the backbone of democracies. So we shall not tolerate our European institutions and agencies’ credibility crumbling just because of some individuals’ interest, and we should always remain vigilant in making sure and guaranteeing that they are not influenced by private interest.\\nFor this reason, we call on the Commission to assess the current practice on post—public employment at European and national level, to extend this review to pre-public employment conflicts of interest, and also to put in place a harmonised legal framework, which should include an extension of the possibility to block professional moves and the provision of a cooling—off period that is proportionate to the specific case and accompanied by an appropriate temporary allowance. Finally, we call on the Commission also to assess whether it is appropriate that the EU agencies concerned decide for themselves on the enforcement of the rules for the prevention of conflicts of interest and how a consistent application of the rules can be ensured. \\nI was glad to see that the resolution was supported unanimously by Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) with no votes against and no abstentions. I hope this is a clear signal and that the plenary widely supports the resolution as well. \\n\\n20, Irene TINAGLI, 2019-12-16, EN, Appointment of members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-16-INT-1-101-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  Rapporteur. – Madam President, with these two reports that will be voted tomorrow, the European Parliament expresses its non-binding opinion on the appointment of two new members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.\\nOver the last month, the Council has recommended the names of Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel and on both candidates the European Central Bank has expressed its positive opinion. The curricula vitae sent to us by the President of the European Council clearly show how both candidates are persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 238 of the Treaty.\\nFabio Panetta has spent his professional career of over 30 years as a central banker. He has served in important positions at national, European and international level, and he is currently the senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy. Isabel Schnabel is a distinguished scholar of one of the most prestigious European universities and for five years she has been a member of the Council of Economic Advisers of Germany. \\nThe ECON Committee submitted to the two candidates a written questionnaire of over 50 questions and subsequently organised a public hearing. The vast support received by Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel, 90% and 70% respectively, demonstrates the very wide appreciation of the ECON Committee for these two excellent candidates. \\nHowever, the two reports do not simply express our support for Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel; they recall and renew battles that the European Parliament has been fighting for some time. \\nFirst and foremost, the battle for a selection and appointing procedure that involved the Parliament more. Of course, we appreciated that after our requests the President of the Eurogroup, Mário Centeno, by publicly announcing which nominations had been received for each position, has made the selection process more transparent than in the past. However, we reiterate our request that the Council, before each of its recommendations, submits to the Parliament a list of at least two names where at least one man and one woman are present. \\nOnly in this way will it be possible to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women in the selection procedures for top positions in our institutions, and therefore to favour gender balance in management bodies.\\nWe already have achieved some important results in this regard. In the last six months, half of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank was renewed, and two out of the three new members are women. One third of the Executive Board will be composed by women, and let us not forget that one of them has been appointed as the President of the ECB. \\nHowever, this is not enough. A few months ago, European newspapers published a photo of the ECB Governing Council, that is the other management body of the ECB, and there was only one woman in that picture – Madame Lagarde herself. \\nOf course this is not due to the nomination process we are discussing; this is due to the fact that the non-executive part of the ECB Governing Council is composed by all the governors of the national central banks of the euro area, and all of them happen to be men. \\nThis makes it clear that our aim for a gender-balanced representation in European bodies can be reached only if this process takes place everywhere in national institutions first. For this reason, we call on the Council to forward our message to all Member States. \\nTo conclude, I just want to say that our support for these two excellent candidates, and our responsibility in guaranteeing the correct and regular functioning of the ECB, while safeguarding interinstitutional cooperation, shall not diminish our battles which we will continue fighting with determination in the future.\\n\\n21, Irene TINAGLI, 2019-12-16, EN, Fair taxation in a digitalised and globalised economy - BEPS 2.0 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-16-INT-1-127-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  author. – Madam\\xa0President, USD\\xa0240 billion dollars: according to OECD estimates this is the amount of missing tax revenues due to multinationals’ tax elusion. Researchers from Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen estimated that in 2016, 40% of big companies’ profits were shifted to tax havens every year. For many countries, this means losing huge portions of tax revenues that could be used to address increasing needs in education, health care, public services and pensions, not to mention investments in physical and digital infrastructures, in research and development: all things that benefit people and firms of all sizes, small and large ones alike.\\nEverybody should contribute to this. But while citizens, consumers and small and medium businesses do pay their share, with effective tax rates that may go up to 40% or even more sometimes, many large multinationals do not, and this is not acceptable anymore. These situations not only create problems of social justice, but also relevant market distortions and unfair competition.\\nWe talk a lot about building a level playing field, but what we have today on tax matters is not level at all. Yes, we want to reward efficiency, we want to reward innovation, but that should take place within a fiscal framework that applies the same tax rules to everyone. That is why we welcome the commitment of 135\\xa0countries that are negotiating, at the OECD level, a reform to address these challenges.\\nOn behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), today I present a resolution and oral questions on these reforms, and we urge the Commission and Member States to act and agree on a joint and ambitious EU position in these negotiations. I thank the Commissioner for being here today to answer our questions. The first one: how does the Commission intend to ensure a common EU position in the current international discussions on tax challenges posed by the digitalisation of the economy? And the second: how does the Commission intend to ensure that the ongoing international discussions around Pillar One are coherent and consistent with EU proposals in this field? And third: how is the Commission preparing the implementation of the outcome of such international deals? And, in the event of a regrettable absence of an international solution, when, and in what form, will the Commission act to ensure a coordinated EU reply?\\nParliament expects an active role of the Commission. Europe can play a fundamental role in shaping this debate only if we are united, only if we speak with one voice. With this initiative, Parliament intends to express its position on two main points. The first one: we should reform the allocation of taxing rights, going beyond the concept of physical presence in order to include all large firms with an active engagement and interaction with customers and users – also by digital means. The second: we encourage a minimum rate to be set at a fair and sufficient level to discourage profit-shifting and prevent damaging tax competition. Indeed, according to the corporate tax statistics by OECD, there are countries where the corporate tax rate is basically zero, and we can’t accept that anymore.\\nSo let me conclude, dear Commissioner and dear colleagues, by saying that it’s time to modernise our tax rules to ensure that big companies pay their fair share of taxes where the value is created and where the economic activity is taking place. We should not ring-fence the digital economy, but we should look at all multinationals that are increasingly finding ways to elude taxes. The current international fiscal regime creates competitive distortions among players; it deprives countries from their sovereign decision to tax corporate profits to finance public services; and most importantly, it increases inequalities and puts most of this fiscal burden on less mobile taxpayers, workers and consumers. This is simply not fair. Our citizens demand tax justice, and it is time to give them an answer.\\n\\n22, Irene TINAGLI, 2019-09-17, EN, Appointment of the President of the European Central Bank - Candidate: Ms Christine Lagarde (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-09-17-INT-2-060-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Irene Tinagli,  Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – Mr\\xa0President, with this report the European Parliament delivers its opinion on the appointment of the fourth President of the European Central Bank – an institution which became a fundamental pillar not only for the conduct of monetary policies but also for the whole process of Europe’s economic integration.\\nThe nomination of Christine Lagarde as the first woman to serve in this position, which is itself something historic, is happening fortuitously only a few months after the solemn celebration in this Chamber of the euro’s 20th anniversary. The single currency is, first and foremost, a powerful economic tool. Not only is it the natural and indispensable complement to the single market, but it is also, as President Mario Draghi often recalls in his speeches, the prerequisite for preserving monetary sovereignty in an increasingly global and interconnected world.\\nThe euro though is more than a mere economic tool: it is, above all, an ambitious political project. It is the cornerstone of a European Union of peace and prosperity and the indispensable instrument for protecting and supporting the European economic, social and political model – as we face the important transformations of our time.\\nOver the past 20 years – despite the imperfection and incompleteness of European economic governance – the single currency has shown amazing strength and resilience, even when confronted with one of the toughest economic crises in history. In addition to the political determination to maintain its integrity, the commitment by the European Central Bank and its Presidents – within their terms of reference, of course – to preserve the single currency through concrete monetary-policy action has made a fundamental contribution to protecting the euro and hence the well-being of all European citizens.\\nThe 76 written answers provided by the candidate, which are attached to the report being voted on today, as well as the intense hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 4\\xa0September, show, I believe, not only Christine Lagarde’s awareness of the task and the challenges ahead but also her suitability to take up the baton from her predecessors and to keep on pursuing this important mission.\\nThe large consensus which the candidate obtained in the committee constitutes, I believe, a good basis for the outcome of today’s vote. However, our task does not end here. In accordance with the Treaties and in line with our committee’s work and that of Parliament as a whole, we will keep on monitoring the activity and decisions of the ECB, inter alia through quarterly monetary dialogues, annual reports and written questions from MEPs. As always, we will be demanding. And we will expect an institution that lives up to the fundamental task it is expected to perform.\\nIf we want to reach our ambitious objectives, however, the strength and the stability of the euro is not sufficient. We need to add new institutions, new tools and truly European economic policies to monetary-policy measures.\\nIt is imperative to pursue an authentic deepening of our economic and monetary union, as was stated too in the programme presented by Commission President-elect Ursula von\\xa0der\\xa0Leyen, which includes measures to ensure the full implementation of the social pillar, as well as growth-oriented revision of European economic governance. In this context, as co-legislator, we are ready to accept the challenge.\\n\\n10, Sandro GOZI, 2023-06-13, EN, This is Europe - Debate with the President of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-094-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Sandro Gozi (Renew).   – Mr President, (start of speech off mic) ... see you again, dear President, dear Nikos, in this function, I have fond memories of our past cooperation. And I know we can fully count on your leadership for a sovereign and democratic Union. \\nYou mention in your speech Jean Monnet and the change of context. I do believe that the Ukrainian conflict has changed the context and that enlargement has become a fundamental geopolitical tool and geopolitical question. \\nAgainst this background, I think that it is not credible to go towards the next enlargement without a deep reform of the European Union, of the institutions, of the common policies, and that we must address the unresolved territorial issues within the Union, in particular in view of the next enlargement. \\nAgainst this background, again, and in view of the Cyprus Presidency in 2026, I would like to better understand from you what are your key priorities for the reform of the European Union and what do you expect the Union to do more or differently with regard to the Cyprus territorial issues to break the deadlock? \\n\\n11, Sandro GOZI, 2023-06-13, EN, Negotiations on the European Electoral Law (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-410-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Sandro Gozi (Renew).   – Madam\\xa0President, dear Minister, dear colleagues, I would have a point of order, because I think that some colleagues, President, haven’t understood what we are talking about tonight. We are not talking about the electoral law. We are asking the Council: when will you start to negotiate with us on electoral law? The electoral law has been approved one year ago. So, the question is not whether we like it or not – the electoral law – the question is to invoke the principle of mutual and sincere cooperation, which is blatantly violated by the Council, which for one year has ignored the proposal of the candidates.\\nSo, I am saying we are preparing the European elections. We are doing our job on the composition of the Parliament. When will you start serious negotiation? We appreciate the effort, the questionnaire. We appreciate the effort of informal discussion, but we want formal negotiation on how we want to prepare the European election in 2024. And this means that we have to discuss the composition of the European Parliament and we have to discuss the electoral law.\\nWe are still waiting from the Council to know this and I’m very happy about your letter. That means that you have taken notice that the Parliament exists. But don’t take notice that the Parliament exists only when it suits you for the composition of the Parliament, take notice that the Parliament exists all the time and start negotiation of the electoral law.\\n(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question)\\n\\n12, Sandro GOZI, 2023-06-13, EN, Negotiations on the European Electoral Law (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-13-INT-2-412-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Sandro Gozi (Renew),  blue-card answer. – I accept the lesson of Professor Rangel.

I never said that the Council, the European Council or the Council of Ministers is less legitimate than the European Parliament, I said the European Parliament plays a role, but no, I didn’t say that.\\nBut I don’t understand why we should not apply the Treaty. And at the moment we are not applying the Treaty because this shift, that push towards the European Council, prevents the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament from doing their job according to the letter of the Treaty. That is the first question.\\nThe second question I mean, who did say that deciding by majority is less democratic than deciding by unanimity? Who said the opposite?\\n\\n34, Sandro GOZI, 2022-05-03, EN, The follow up of the Conference on the Future of Europe (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-03-INT-2-259-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Sandro Gozi (Renew),  blue-card reply. – Yes, I will answer in Italian, so I hope she will understand better.\\nSono convinto che ci sia un\\'identità europea.

No, colleague, I want to reassure you: I am Italian, elected in France, but I don’t think I will be a candidate also in Sweden. But let me say that we don’t take anything away from the Swedish system. Nothing will change for Sweden. Your voters will elect you, or others, exactly in the same way, only they will have an additional democratic choice, an additional democratic power. They will be able also to vote directly for the European People’s Party. I don’t think that today your voters can directly elect your European party. So we only increase democracy, nothing else.\\n\\n0, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2023-11-21, EN, Strengthening the CO2 emission performance targets for new heavy-duty vehicles (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-21-INT-2-087-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, we are all in agreement with our good friend Bas Eickhout – but he\\'s not listening – regarding the need to reduce CO2 emissions on the heavy vehicles. But our approach is a pragmatic one, meaning that before we have very ambitious goals and then we do not reach them, we prefer to have very pragmatic goals that we make sure that all the Member States we reach.\\nThere are three points in which the ECR Group will be fighting on. Number one is the carbon correction factor, which we think is necessary to handle the wide variety of heavy vehicles. Number two is the urban buses. We ran a study in Italy and in most of the largest cities, we reach the goal that is proposed in the text, but most of the smaller cities will not make it because of a whole bunch of different problems, especially on the recharging stations and so on. And last, neutral fuels. We know Germany – and we hear Peter Liese – they are very strong on synthetic fuels. Italy is very strong on biomasses. We do believe that we need to accept all the different type of less impacting fuels.\\n\\n7, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2023-02-14, EN, CO2 emission standards for cars and vans (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-14-INT-2-017-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, Vice—President Timmermans, as an entrepreneur, I really do believe that we should have left it to the market, to companies, to decide what was the best technological solution to solve the problem. \\nWe are all in favour of reducing emissions, of course, but we, as the ECR Group, have some problems. Number one: the workplace, how many jobs can be cancelled by this? What is Europe doing to do something about these workers? Number two: even more important, the dependence on foreign countries, and specifically China, regarding microchips, lithium, cobalt and so on. If we talk about environmental issues – and again I go back to the measurement on the tailpipe – I’ve seen mining operations in Africa and in a lot of countries and I can assure you that the impact on the environment is horrible. So we need to look at that. \\nNow I welcome the input by Commissioner Breton on an impact assessment in 2026, and we are looking at that. I also would like to say to the Vice—President that I hope this is not going to be imposed also on heavy vehicles and agricultural vehicles because that’s a different problem. \\nI conclude again by saying why not give bonuses to scrap all the Euro\\xa00, Euro\\xa01, Euro\\xa02, Euro\\xa03 and Euro\\xa04 vehicles so that we can reduce the output by 40%?\\n\\n9, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2022-10-04, EN, Key objectives for the CITES CoP19 meeting in Panama (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-04-INT-2-172-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam\\xa0President, I have a very practical question for the Commission, and regarding this topic, I will present a separate vote on a paragraph\\xa039, which bans the import of a hunting trophy.\\nAs a person that has worked a lot in Africa for many years, I know the situation very well, and I work on the side of people defending biodiversity. But, for example, in Namibia, trophy hunting, which is legal trophy hunting, is almost 5% of the gross national product and is very important from a biodiversity protection and an economic point of view, because all the meat goes to tribes, part of the money goes to the tribes for schooling, in exchange of not poaching. Because we have to remember that a lot of animal killings in Africa are done by the tribes to protect their agricultural land, for reason, because they need food, also for money. And so this system works; brings a positive economic effect, brings protection of biodiversity. So I would like to believe this is possible.\\nAnd by the way, I’m in contact with the ambassadors of Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique, and I would like to bring them here to explain exactly the numbers in their respective countries.\\n\\n11, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2022-03-10, EN, The need for an ambitious EU Strategy for sustainable textiles (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-10-INT-4-044-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam\\xa0President, I fully agree with the position of the Commissioner. There are unluckily two major problems regarding the textile sector. They are very technical. Number one is the colouring of the textile, which is on one side strongly regulated by the Workers’ Safety Regulation, the Environmental Emissions Regulation and so on, but on the other side is still a problem. We need funds and we need research centres so that we can change 2\\xa0000 years of history.\\nThe other problem is the release of micro- and nanoplastics. And for this, we do not have a technical solution to filter and take out this nanoplastic from the water that goes into the sea and then gets eaten by the fish and then we eat them. Now, of course, I would like to see on these funds to find a solution about this. Reduction of artificial textiles is a solution but it is not the only solution. I would like to see a full economic, social and technical assessment of a more stringent regulation on the textile sector, because otherwise we are going to kill a very important economic thing. \\nOn the positive side, we do have all the social media platforms that are trading in used clothing which are reducing the number of clothes going to the landfills.\\nLast but not least, I really do not understand the politically correct approach in opposition to natural fibres and to natural material like leather and fur. They are natural, they last longer than the artificial stuff, they do not contain microplastic. So are we defending the environment or the animals?\\n\\n12, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2022-02-15, EN, Strengthening Europe in the fight against cancer(debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-15-INT-2-018-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam\\xa0President, this is a great and powerful document, I believe, and I’m proud to be part of it. I’m already using it, even if it’s not finalised, to put pressure on the Italian regional authorities to increase the screening programme and to increase the funding on new screening and therapeutic techniques.\\nAlso, we already started locally, based on these programmes, to increase the quality of life of cancer patients through ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery), which takes into account the entire system before and after the hospital stay.\\nOn the other side, I’m not happy with some decisions regarding prevention. I presented some amendments to correct this. First of all, the increase in taxation and limitation for alcohol and cigarettes has always been a counter—productive approach, potentially causing illegal and criminal activity but also really bad behaviour, especially in the poor sector of the population.\\nSecond, I am a strong believer that there is a difference between moderate and excessive alcohol consumption. This was a big discussion, but we all know that the Mediterranean diet has shown an increase in lifespan through the general population.\\nThird, I strongly believe that alternatives to traditional smoke is an important tool to reduce smoking in Europe. It’s never been shown a positive outcome in reducing bad habits through taxation, as we have seen, and through banning marketing, as we have seen for cigarettes.\\nTo conclude, the report, again, is a very powerful tool, and we should all use it in a very aggressive and powerful way for the good of all European citizens.\\n\\n18, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2020-07-09, EN, Chemicals strategy for sustainability (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-07-09-INT-2-119-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam\\xa0President, as a shadow rapporteur, I’m sorry to say that I am not in agreement with a lot of the compromise amendments. If all the amendments are approved, the regulation will be extremely punishing, especially for the small and micro enterprises. I’m very familiar with this matter, given my 35 years as an entrepreneur with strong experience in the REACH regulation, occupational safety and health, CoP regulation and producer responsibility.\\nThere are some extremely problematic points, among which the juridical nightmare of a regulation that wants to change another regulation like the CoP and occupational safety – this is an extremely complex and expensive burden on the effects of combined or multiple chemicals which is very difficult to handle. The introduction of the concept of ‘no data, no market’ is very dangerous for a lot of smaller companies and the impossibility of finding better alternatives to banned substances in a short time. I’m a strong believer in the concept of banning dangerous substances, but the direction this regulation has taken will create massive competitive disadvantages for all EU companies, especially the small ones. Again, the focus is on the companies which are already heavily regulated, and nothing is said about what comes out of private homes.\\n\\n20, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2019-12-11, EN, The European Green Deal (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-12-11-INT-1-045-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi (ECR).   – Madam\\xa0President, and dear missing President of the Commission, Ms\\xa0von der Leyen – I hope this is not a sign of the times to come: that she thinks she can avoid listening to a democratically—elected parliament – I want to state that I am 110% behind the new Green Deal, but I have two strong demands to the – missing – Commission President, Ms\\xa0von der Leyen. Number one: force the US, India and China to follow our path, because otherwise our New Green Deal will be useless and counter—productive. Number two: when you devise the operative plan to reach the goal, put business and companies and jobs as the highest priority, because we do not want all industries to relocate to Africa, to Turkey or to the US. \\n\\n21, Pietro FIOCCHI, 2019-11-25, EN, Climate and environmental emergency - 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2019-11-25-INT-1-063-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pietro Fiocchi (ECR).   – Madam\\xa0President, I am an engineer and an industrial entrepreneur. I have this intimate need to understand how to reach goals. We all agree that we need to do something about climate change, but how? My team and I analysed, for the best part of two months, how to reach the Paris Agreement goals and we could not find a good technical answer. We then asked everybody and the only answer we got was that we raise taxes and then see what we do. This is not good. Also, nobody commented on the fact that the US, India and China are not doing anything about this and are therefore making the European efforts totally useless.\\nNow we want to raise the bar. This is problematic because we, as the European Parliament, have a moral duty to explain to EU citizens how we intend to reach the goals, and how we intend to do this without killing their livelihoods and the economy. \\n\\n1, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-12-12, EN, Defence of democracy package (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-12-12-INT-2-268-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, in a failing European democracy, with tragic backsliding of rule of law in Hungary and authoritarian threats coming from inside and outside, the defence of democracy is a hugely important topic, one that requires a carefully considered proposal in the light of all the challenges: malicious interference in our electoral processes; disinformation from Chinese, Russian, and other actors; the use of spyware against opposition candidates; the increasing criminalisation of civil society by politicians; and the numerous attacks against journalists.\\nLike others in this House, I have spent this mandate fighting to protect democracy and fundamental rights with the help of civil society throughout. Civil society is instrumental in safeguarding EU values, so we need to address the lack of transparency requirements for interest representatives, but without endangering the work of NGOs.\\nThe foreign agents aspect in this package risks so much to sabotage the work of civil society. It could even play into the hands of those who are already looking to target civil society at any cost, instead of addressing the real democratic flaws.\\n\\n2, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-11-23, EN, Digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation - Digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation (amendment of certain directives and framework decisions) (joint debate – Judicial cooperation), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-23-INT-4-094-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, issues related to the digitalisation of justice look merely technical at first sight, but they are highly political.\\nI know we all agree this is about ensuring more efficient justice systems and a better access to justice for everyone. But as the European Commission, the Council, and a majority of this European Parliament actively promote this digitalisation at all costs, we should not forget it can also have harmful impact on the fairness of criminal proceedings, as well as the rights guaranteed to suspects and accused persons.\\nFirst of all, digital tools should be an exception and not the norm. Using videoconference during a trial will never be equivalent with being physically present.\\nThen also, not everyone has equal access to digitalisation. When implementing these two new pieces of legislation, Member States need to ensure people with learning difficulties, physical disability, children, and those who haven’t learned to use technologies can still enjoy their right to access justice.\\n\\n3, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-11-22, EN, Cyprus Confidential - need to curb enablers of sanctions-evasion and money-laundering rules in the EU (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-22-INT-3-286-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, once again, thanks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, we are made aware of a huge money laundering scandal in the EU. The latest investigation shows how financial firms in Cyprus have aided Russian oligarchs in hiding their wealth offshore. So it seems that Cyprus has widely contributed to Russian influence through its golden passports and visa schemes. Dozens of Russian billionaires were clients of the island’s professional service providers. Some have come under sanctions since February 2022 and others since 2014. 800 companies registered in tax and secrecy havens, all controlled by Russians. This poses a wider question about the capacity of our institutions to prevent these deficiencies from rotting our union from within. It took years for the Commission to start acting on golden passport schemes. Right now, Malta is not even considering stopping its own scheme. We have to call this what it is: selling European citizenship to make dirty money, giving the opportunity to dangerous people or mafia or foreign malicious actors to interfere and exert power in the EU. It needs to stop. \\n\\n5, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-11-21, EN, Continuing threat to the rule of law, the independence of justice and the non-fulfilment of conditionality for EU funding in Hungary (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-21-INT-2-426-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, European funds for Hungary were frozen because of concerns about whether this money was reaching its legitimate beneficiaries – Hungarian citizens. Years of misuse of this money had shown us that most of the time, it landed in the pockets of oligarchs and helped enrich Orbán’s friends and close relatives. This has ultimately dramatically reinforced the powers of this new autocrat. \\nThere is little reason to think the outcome would be different today. It seems the right boxes have been ticked on the right forms, yes, indeed, but no implementation. And we are facing a lot of opacity about the dialogue between the Commission and the Hungarian Government. \\nBut above all, one major problem remains the allocation of cases in the judiciary. Through all of these years, the very rare cases of political and corruption trials would land in the hands of judges close to the regime, always the very same judges with a very mysterious but very convenient allocation system. To have serious restoration of the rule of law in Hungary, the allocation of political corruption cases is what needs to be addressed first. \\nBut now I want to be very clear on one thing where I feel that we have been misleading stakeholders, ambassadors and citizens. Cutting EU funds to Hungary means protecting our money and it is good. But it will not resolve the systemic rule of law collapse in the country. For this to happen, we need political will and courage coming from the Council. It is a straightforward democratic political process that is clearly written in our rules and Treaties: recommendations, sanctions and the withdrawal of voting rights. When Viktor Orbán no longer has voting rights in the name of Hungary, then he will also no longer be able to use his people and his nation as a leverage for his own benefit. \\nFor a few days now, new billboards are depicting Ursula von der Leyen and the Commission as new scapegoats and advertising on an upcoming anti-EU referendum in Hungary. This national consultation named on the defence of our sovereignty as 11 questions, all of them concerning Brussels. Full of lies and misperception. It declares that Brussels wants to create migrant ghettos in Hungary, financial support from Brussels to Palestinian organisation has also reached Hamas, and it finishes with this: they – they being us, of course – want to influence Hungarian politics using money from Brussels and overseas. How are we letting this happen? \\n\\n6, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-11-08, EN, EU enlargement policy 2023 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-08-INT-1-154-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, the EU urgently needs to rethink the way it approaches enlargement. The accession process must increase direct work with civil society, rather than focusing only on bilateral discussions with national governments.\\nThe 2023 enlargement package stresses a new momentum for the Western Balkans. Good! But reforms have largely stalled in the region; citizens there are deeply disappointed by their own governments and by the EU. When I meet them in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Montenegro, I am energised by a strong civil society fighting for democratic changes and a more peaceful political debate in difficult, sometimes autocratic, circumstances.\\nWe are opening up the accession process to Ukraine and Moldova, but we are not making progress with our neighbours in the Western Balkans. What message does this send to those fighting for European values there?\\nThe future of the Western Balkans is in Europe. We have common history and shared challenges: security in the face of Russian aggression, safeguarding democracy, upholding rule of law and protecting the environment. But this means real dialogue and sincere cooperation, not loose commercial relationships with corrupted administrations and despotic leaders.\\n\\n7, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-10-18, EN, Rule of Law in Malta: 6 years after the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia and the need to protect journalists (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-10-18-INT-3-307-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, we are once again talking about the situation of rule of law in Malta, and this is very necessary. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia has not been investigated efficiently. The mastermind behind it has not yet been convicted. Justice is slow to act and, in general, the culture of impunity still seems to be very present on the island.\\nThe public inquiry found that the journalist’s assassination was predictable and preventable. There is evidence linking this to the former government. So why has this not been a wake-up alarm for Maltese politics? Still today, journalists do not feel safe in Malta.\\nAnd then we have the disease of corruption – corruption scandals coming one after the other, the latest one in March 2023. Investigative journalists revealed a EUR\\xa0200\\xa0million public contract signed in 2017 by the government, privatising free hospitals. The management was transferred to a company totally incompetent for it. Since then, the deal has been ignored by a court for suspicion of corruption and fraud.\\nSo, yes, sometimes it feels like democracy is suffocating in Malta: huge difficulties to access public information, public officials being protected from prosecution, incredible number of lawsuits against journalists, houses collapsing because building standards have not been met, money laundering, golden visas, a polarised landscape maintaining old powers in place, attacks on women’s rights. And I could go on.\\nYes, in this Parliament, we are all well aware of all of this happening in Malta. But I am also very well aware that if we’ve had in this Parliament a number of debates – numerous debates – about Malta and a number of strong resolutions about Malta, it seems that we never have the time or the opportunity to have in-depth public scrutiny of the situation of the rule of law in other countries, like Greece or Bulgaria, for example, with a high level of corruption and very big threats for journalists.\\nSo why is that? I was wondering: is this Parliament suffering from a high sensitivity to rule of law issues only when it’s about countries that are not governed by the EPP?\\n\\n8, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-09-11, EN, Amendments to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure with a view to strengthening integrity, independence and accountability (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-09-11-INT-1-106-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, this is not going to make the headlines, it will have a thousand times less coverage than Qatargate and it is not even close to being the perfect, fresh new start that this Parliament needs. But it is a first step towards serious reform, real transparency requirements and preventing future conflicts of interest. \\nHere, in this Parliament, in which it has been incredibly difficult to have this topic on the agenda for so many years, a parliament which has previously been in favour of shutting down any constraint on its members, this has been a lonely uphill struggle most of the time but since Qatargate, we have found a lot more allies in nearly all groups, notably the Socialists. Before me, there were other green MEPs fighting for these changes and in the next term others will come, including the new generation, fighting for these changes and coming from all political groups. \\nBecause total opacity on money and side jobs is no longer acceptable. This cannot be framed as free mandate. There is no unlawful right to misuse the money, the public money, or to receive unnecessary money from outside. Public money should not enrich politicians and public policies should not be made under the pressure and interference of dirty money. This is the basis of democracy – we say this to the rest of the world, we say this to our own Member States, we say it to other institutions and we say it to businesses. But in this Parliament, we still look to have the least constraints on MEPs, the least possible. \\nBut these rules, now that we have them, they can make a healthy democracy because there is no European healthy democracy without clean European institutions. If we fail this time, we will be heading into the next European elections, sending a signal that this Parliament has no problem sheltering those few MEPs that profit from their mandate at the expense of citizens and democracies.\\n\\n9, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-07-12, EN, Recommendations for reform of the European Parliament’s rules on transparency, integrity, accountability and anti-corruption (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-07-12-INT-3-418-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, as our House is currently working on modifications to the Rules of Procedure to fight against corruption and strengthen transparency after Qatargate, I would like us to take inspiration from other bodies and parliaments to come up with stronger rules and to better be able to implement them.\\nWhen we went on a mission to the UK Parliament last month, I was quite amazed by the strict rules that are implemented there to increase integrity and accountability, especially in such a conservative Parliament. It is not often that we can hold the UK up as a good example these days. But let us take this opportunity to learn from our neighbours and make sure that there is a real role carved out for our independent experts working on the conflict of interest and on harassment as full members in our advisory committees.\\nWe must put in place clear strict rules on MEPs’ interests, with sanctions for those who decide not to respect them, as well as making these sanctions public and visible on the web page of the European Parliament. \\nFinally, since this world is evolving fast and our standards needs to constantly progress, let’s review our rules on a regular basis to see what is working and what is not.\\n\\n11, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-06-01, EN, Foreign interference in all democratic processes in the European Union, including disinformation - Election integrity and resilience build-up towards European elections 2024 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-01-INT-2-029-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, foreign interference is not something that we can take lightly, especially when EU values and our democracies are called into question. In order to safeguard our democracies we all know that the most important is to improve transparency. This is crucial. This means not only for us as Members of this Parliament, but also for think tanks, foundations and the private companies that we work with.\\nHowever, we need to get the balance right. At times, this narrative of monitoring and legislating against foreign interference veers dangerously close to calling for the censorship and criminalisation of NGOs. But without defending a free and functioning civil society, we cannot claim to defend EU values. Civil society organisations are precisely the actors that have defended EU values, worked to prevent foreign Russian interference in the EU and in its neighbourhood countries, and put pressure on us to act to prevent further authoritarian backsliding. If we criminalise civil society, we run the risk of undermining the very values upon which this Union is built.\\n\\n12, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-05-31, EN, Breaches of the Rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary and frozen EU funds (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-31-INT-1-128-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the Hungarian Government has pushed through new legislation asking citizens to report activities that go against the Hungarian way of life – in other words, anything that does not conform with the official Hungarian Government’s narrative on the rule of marriage, the traditional family or the illiberal democracy. The wording in this legislation was withdrawn this Friday after two months of pressure, coming notably from this Parliament. \\nBut let us reflect on what was at stake. A society based on generalised surveillance, where you are encouraged to spy on your neighbours, your colleagues, your friends, and then to denounce them for their personal thoughts or their love life. A new step on the path towards authoritarianism. A society of constant fear, the end of freedom of expression, the end of privacy. \\nThis is the world the Hungarian Government wants us all to live in – a parallel world inspired by Vladimir Putin, where minority rights are not protected, where rainbow families are unlawful, where the Russian war in Ukraine is not recognised, where European values and the definition of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are denied, and where disinformation about what the European Union does is on billboards and in official speeches nearly every day. \\nShould we let the Hungarian Government set the agenda of the EU for six months when they themselves say they do not respect what we are and what we stand for? What the European Parliament is asking for is only to start the conversation about this crucial issue. \\n\\n13, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-05-10, EN, Update of the anti-corruption legislative framework (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-10-INT-3-320-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, there is no healthy democracy with corruption. Not only does corruption destroy public services and hurt deeply the finances of a country, but it also creates imbalance in powers, and it fosters a climate of threats and fear because those wanting to uncover corruption need to be silenced by those corrupted. And this is why we have, in the EU, journalists getting killed because they are investigating corruption cases.\\nAnd the EU is sick because of so much corruption involving high-level politicians, public servants and public funds in so many heavy sectors of the economy – healthcare, transportation, construction, waste management, aerospace and defence, agriculture, food, labour, social protection, a number of European economic sectors. And we know the documented and the most grave situations: Hungary, Malta, Czech Republic, Greece, Croatia, Bulgaria. But in fact, all EU Member States are concerned and we have, for the moment, not been good at all at enforcing our rules. We are very good at saying rules but not at enforcing them.\\n\\n14, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-05-10, EN, Adequacy of the protection afforded by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-10-INT-3-431-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, again the Commission is trying to allow unconditional flows of personal data across the Atlantic. Once again, the Commission is using our fundamental rights as collateral in the quest for a closer transatlantic relationship – and, once again, we find ourselves here in this Parliament urging the Commission to do the right thing and not to grant, to the US, an inadequate level of data protection. \\nIn the EU, our right to data protection is enshrined in law. Citizens know that the collection of the data is only done when necessary and in a proportional way, and in case of a breach they are able to challenge this in a court of law and to know the outcome. In the US, the executive order that was issued in October 2022 does not take the place of a federal data protection law, nor does it pave the way for the end of the ongoing mass surveillance or bulk collection of data by the US National Security Agency. \\nIt also does not change the fact that European victims of US surveillance are unable to seek effective judicial redress. The latest agreement may be called the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, but this new name does not reflect the reality. No sufficient changes have been made in the US to safeguard personal data without significant reforms. \\nIt is quite clear that the US does not have an essentially equivalent level of data protection. There is also, of course, a significant risk that all of this will anyway be struck down by the CJEU again. This means more legal uncertainty and disruption for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. \\nThis debate is about protecting our personal data, but it is also about protecting our EU values, fundamental rights and civil liberties. \\n\\n15, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-03-29, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-29-INT-1-054-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, indeed, the Democracy, Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights Monitoring Group (DRFMG) went on a mission to Greece recently, and we made assessments of a number of issues concerning rule of law and fundamental rights. We therefore now need an open debate in this House.\\nIt has been, in fact, a longstanding demand from a number of Members of this Parliament, coming from different groups already for a long time, because our concerns are serious. In fact, it’s been nearly one year that we’ve been waiting, because on 9 April 2021, Giorgos Karaivaz was assassinated – a sinister remembrance of the deaths of Daphne Caruana Galizia and Ján Kuciak, journalists all murdered in relation to corruption. \\nThat is why we need on this debate, like on others today, a debate in this House. We make this request with a Commission statement, please, because the Council will not be there tomorrow. We will also need a resolution to be voted in April, and we propose to be in the joint debate tomorrow with the 2022 Rule of Law report – and we ask for RCV, of course.\\n\\n16, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-03-14, EN, Implementation report on the Agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU - The Windsor Framework (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-03-14-INT-2-464-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, 20 years ago, the Good Friday Agreement was signed. This major step will be commemorated with the importance it deserves.\\nSadly, for more than a year now, the Assembly in Northern Ireland has not been sitting. In its absence, citizens in Northern Ireland have struggled to access health care and financial support for energy bills. Polling shows that those in favour of restoring the Assembly in Northern Ireland and those who support the Windsor framework are young people and women. But because of the institutions not fully functioning, young people and women are also among those seriously affected by the lack of access to basic care and by inflated energy prices.\\nWhat matters most to people in Northern Ireland, as everywhere else in Europe, is everyday issues. As often is the case, when identity politics are instrumentalized and take up all the political space, it comes at the cost of people\\'s needs. This is not only about the relationship between the EU and the UK. We also must consider the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland. The EU has a responsibility to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to prioritize the rights of citizens and to contribute to maintaining peace and democracy on the island of Ireland.\\n\\n17, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-02-15, EN, The erosion of the rule of law in Greece: the wiretapping scandal and media freedom (topical debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-15-INT-3-175-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, Greece, State of Play, 2023. Eleni Touloupaki, former head of the corruption prosecutor\\'s office, has been attacked by her own government after an investigation about the scandal involving the Novartis Pharma company. And now she suspects that she was spied on as many others were in the Greek political context. Meanwhile, the wiretapping scandal, we know, is ongoing. \\nGiorgos Karaivaz, a long-time crime reporter was assassinated in April 2021, and since then there\\'s been no real follow-up to find out who killed him and what the motivation was. Journalists are terrified, activists too. NGOs working on migration issues are harassed. And even in this Parliament, it took us months to have this small debate on the agenda, not one on the wiretapping, but one on the systemic degradation of the rule of law, corruption, democracy, judiciary, media pluralism. And it doesn\\'t seem that the Commission is sufficiently also challenging this. So I\\'m really wondering, have we not learned any lesson? Will Greece be the next sick man after Hungary of this Europe? And will we act once again when it\\'s too late? \\n\\n18, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2023-02-14, EN, Establishment of an independent EU Ethics Body (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-02-14-INT-2-327-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, transparency and accountability are easy and simple requirements to put in place and so it remains a mystery why it is taking us so much time to make it happen. We have been cowardly and weak, because at the same time we were very eager to ask for transparency and accountability from others – from businesses, corporations, lobbyists, democracies, countries, institutions and now NGOs. \\nOf course, when you don’t want to take action and when you don’t want to be scrutinised, the best thing to do is to find a scapegoat. Some now are using a narrative which criminalised NGOs in the same way that liberal democracies do in order to avoid dealing with our own lack of rules and implementation. \\nThere is another argument preventing us from concrete measures – the famous ‘additional burden’. But it is not that complicated to give straightforward information about assets; how wealthy we were at the start of the political term, and how wealthy we are at the end – because no enrichment should be considered normal in our Parliament duty. Maybe, it is time to discuss what a public mandate is and what the general interest is. \\nWe have very good conditions of work. They make us efficient parliamentarians. We can commission studies, we can travel using our own expenses, we can meet different stakeholders, we can organise hearings. We should be informed members, but independent in the way we take our legislative decision.\\nAnd such an independence, in such good conditions, demands high integrity. This level of integrity is possible if we have an ethics body, which monitors the three European institutions in a serious way. When such an authority was created in France, it dramatically increased awareness and morality in political life. It is an indispensable tool to fight corruption. \\nLet’s stop finding excuses, looking for the guilty party elsewhere. Let’s stop these stories and scandals around Commissioners and MEPs. Let’s be a 21st century democracy, healthy and secure, one in which policies are made for the common good and not in the interest of a few people.\\n\\n19, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-12-14, EN, Defending the European Union against the abuse of national vetoes (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-14-INT-3-204-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, dear smaller Member States, by size or by population, I know you have always fought fiercely for national vetoes and I simply do not understand it. We have all witnessed recently how national vetoes have dramatically been to the advantage of the few bad guys in the room. National vetoes have been used in bad faith against European interests. \\nThey have been an instrument to pressure you against your own will when you were deciding on essential European policies together. They have made your efforts to find common ground more fragile and all of this has threatened our security. It has also allowed the misuse of the money of European citizens. And some important files became simple pawns in a cynical gambling game. \\nAnd why? Smaller Member States should not fear the end of unanimity, Europe has grown and changed. You can protect your interests through qualified majority, and you have proven that you are good at finding these majorities when needed. \\nThroughout this term, I have had the most respect for the Czech Presidency, the Finnish Presidency, the Portuguese Presidency. You were the ones that brought everyone around the table to talk about difficult topics and try to make progress. And you were the ones that engaged sincerely with Parliament.

I’m serious! I’m serious! When vetoes are used when the country is not interested in the real content of the policies and it’s just using it to have deals on another topic, that is very problematic. That’s why I think that those that are using it in good faith are weakening their own work, and that’s why I’m saying that they are good enough now to find majorities and they would not need it.

A Senate report in France has clearly documented it. Chinese student spies or some officials are monitoring research to impose their narrative on the issues of the Uyghurs or Taiwan. Some researchers were even pressured by the heads of the universities to delete criticism towards the Chinese Government and to use alternative wording in certain publications or conferences. \\nBut now we know that even worse is happening. There is proof that there is a far—reaching network of overseas Chinese police stations established in many of our Member States – in France, in Spain, in Greece. Chinese citizens who found refuge in these countries are tracked by the Chinese police and forced into returning back to China.\\nThis is also happening in the Netherlands and Ireland, which have launched investigations, and this is happening in Hungary and Serbia. But both of these countries are denying these allegations and are not preventing this from happening. \\nThat is how bad the level of foreign interference has become in the European Union and in neighbour countries. \\n\\n23, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-11-21, EN, Assessment of Hungary\\'s compliance with the rule of law conditions under the Conditionality Regulation and state of play of the Hungarian RRP (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-21-INT-1-056-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, there cannot be – in no place in the world because it’s just not possible – a true, efficient, anti—corruption system where there is not independence of the judiciary. And it feels bizarre to have to say it out loud, but because we have to state the obvious, let’s imagine.\\nLet’s imagine a Member State where the son—in—law of the leader of the country has just been awarded a tender in the context of public procurement concerning European funds. All very fictional, of course. And all of this was done in mysterious ways. There are a number of important problematic failures in the procedures, and there’s this new tool that has been created and implemented in this country. We could name it the ‘Integrity Authority’. And it’s just been created and it’s a really independent monitoring body. It has serious expertise and good staff, and it will bring the case to court. Plenty of fact, plenty of evidence.\\nAnd then the president of the highest level of justice in this country, let’s call it the Supreme Court, decides to allocate himself the case to a judge because, you know, he is a friend of the leader of the country, he has been nominated at this job by friends of the leaders and he has the power to overrule on political cases. Still, very theoretical. And so he gives the case to a specific judge, another friend of all of these people, all friends, all sharing the same interests, the same money. And then, of course, the case drags on and drags on and justice is never made. End of story.\\nHow we can be studying, on one side, the- 17 measures to fight anti—corruption in Hungary and, on the other side, not requesting a true plan of reforms for judiciary bewilders me.\\n\\n24, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-10-19, EN, Whitewashing of the anti-European extreme right in the EU (topical debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-131-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, far right is seeking normalisation and we are giving it to them. First, they had to disguise their fascist legacy, their most frightening symbols and their worst racist, violent rhetoric. Second, they asked right—wing and liberal centrists to open the door, to let them in a bit, accessing little places of power in Parliament, even in government, and spreading this false narrative that sometimes the left would be more extremist than far—right. It happened in Austria, now Italy, Sweden, France.\\nAnd now third, we should be all reassured because they are not claiming they want to leave the European Union anymore. But why should they? They can do scary far—right politics, take the money, use the single market and influence the decisions. Viktor Orbán paved the way. Eating up the EU from the inside is the new respectable path of power for the far right.\\n\\n25, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-10-17, EN, The Rule of Law in Malta, five years after the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-17-INT-1-097-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam\\xa0President, Daphne Caruana\\xa0Galizia was murdered five years ago, and yesterday, on the anniversary of her death, everyone seemed to want to honour her life. But are we truly entitled to do so? The truth is, that story is ugly and dirty, and it has left a long—lasting stain on Malta’s democracy, Malta’s society and that government’s legacy.\\nBut it is also a very depressing story because it has revealed the real state of democracy and media freedom across the whole of the European Union. Sadly, worse, it is a never—ending story because since Daphne Caruana\\xa0Galizia’s tragic killing, other journalists were murdered in other Member States – and numerous others have received threats. The context is always the same – courageous journalists who are investigating corruption cases linked to high—level individuals in government, construction industry, shipping, energy supply, golden visas – the common thing behind these attacks is always the link between criminal organisations, politicians and bribery.\\nAnd what good has been done to help journalists? Well, let’s see. In Malta, the police inquiry was blocked from advancing and the legislation to protect journalists is still not in place. For the rest of Europe, I have never met journalists who are as afraid as they are in Greece; in France, you can be detained by the police just for covering a demonstration, and in Poland and Hungary, you can be spied on like in the time of the Stasi. Media freedom is not good in the European Union.\\n\\n26, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-10-04, EN, Commission proposal for measures under the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation in the case of Hungary (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-04-INT-2-266-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, I would ask what you do if you want to take big chunks of European money for your own benefit or to enrich those around you? Well, you go into government, then you create very loose public procurement rules – rules that you know you will not respect anyway – you manage to channel most of your funds to your son—in—law, for example, who will not build with this money what he is supposed to build, but he will keep most of the money for himself. This is documented by the European Agency for Anti-Corruption. It is discussed at length in this European Parliament. It is known in all European institutions. Courageous journalists will do reports on it. Then, when the Commission can no longer not take action on this because they have got pressure, when the Commission needs you to find a tweak to allow them to go on not dealing with the situation, that is when you wrap it up all with very good legalistic jargon and you pledge for a fake anti-corruption mechanism. This is when you have managed to legalise a decade of stealing. \\n\\n29, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-09-14, EN, Existence of a clear risk of a serious breach by Hungary of the values on which the Union is founded (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-09-14-INT-3-217-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  rapporteur. – Mr President, if Hungary had been a country outside of the European Union, we would have defined very precisely the regime that is in place years ago. We did not because we feel trapped in this situation and we are very uncomfortable. I think that indulgence was given to Hungary more than the contrary. \\nI also wanted to say if a Member State of this European Union has structural deficiencies in one topic like judiciary, independence of judiciary or corruption, it would need a debate and it needs work and this is very frequently done for a number of Member States in this plenary, but this report is something else. This report is an interim report. It is an exhaustive report about a systemic problem in Hungary that is so grave that it cannot be resolved with different resolutions. \\nNow, this Parliament has done its work to the utmost of its duty. We cannot do more. Once again, to answer those that spoke in this room today, democracy is not the imposition of the majority against all the others. It is not that. It is not crushing the ones that are different from you. Democracy is not refusing those that don’t have Christian values to exist. And democratic fair elections are not elections that are made in a system where opposition has no voice, where the constituencies have been changed, where constitutional rules are different all the time and where equal votes are not made. \\nAnd a democratic government is not a government that tells lies, lies, for example, about the European Union. A democratic government doesn’t say that the European Union is prepared to send young Hungarians to the war in Ukraine. A democratic government doesn’t say that the European Union wants to change the sex of children in little schools. This is not democratic procedures. \\nSo, that is why we need to do much more about Hungary and that is what this report is about. But now, and I agree with you, Mr Commissioner, it’s in the hands of the Council and I think that we cannot do any more here. And I’m very worried because I don’t see anything happening and we need recommendations. And maybe one day we need to envisage the difficult questions of sanctions and we start withdrawing the votes of Hungary in the Council.\\n\\n30, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-07-06, EN, Presentation of the programme of activities of the Czech Presidency (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-07-06-INT-3-042-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, I say to the Prime Minister, I am now going to do my very, very, very traditional and boring speech about the Article\\xa07 procedure, which I do every new Council presidency, because this procedure is now in your hands and we have to rely on you to make things happen.\\nIt was four years ago that this European Parliament launched Article 7(1) of the Treaties against the Hungarian Government about the situation of democracy, of rights and of freedom in that Member State. Since then, we have been working tirelessly with all EU presidencies to get the Council to move forward. Every time you delay the procedures, not only are you giving the Hungarian Government more leverage to dismantle the rule of law in their own country, but you are allowing them to threaten the whole European project. We count on the Czech Presidency to be one of those that show leadership and seek to break this cycle of inertia and lack of courage.\\n\\n34, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-06-06, EN, 2021 Report on Turkey (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-06-INT-1-075-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, this is a very good report and a strong report and so it needs to be followed with strong actions. This report highlights that our approach so far has failed to seriously address the human rights crisis in Turkey that is becoming extremely dire alongside the erosion of democracy and the rule of law.\\nThe Turkish authorities have constantly disregarded the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. We were one month ago, less than one month ago, in this Parliament, discussing the concerns we have on the aggravated life sentence handed to Osman\\xa0Kavala in 2022. The treatment of migrants at the border in the country is a disgrace for EU because we continue to subcontract how we deal with the situation. We still consider them as a real partner and we act as though we believe that there is a shared mutual respect for human rights, and there is not.\\nAnd also, discrimination and criminalisation of Kurds in Turkey is not met with enough scrutiny on our part and in general by international stakeholders. Generalised discrimination of minorities continues, while the European Commission continues to engage in high—level dialogues. Of course, it is a step in the right direction that the EU—Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee took place earlier this year. But this report shows that we urgently need a much more severe attitude that can no longer be based on mutual trust.\\n\\n35, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-05-04, EN, Use of the Pegasus Software by EU Member States against individuals including MEPs and the violation of fundamental rights (topical debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-04-INT-3-268-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, has deeply invasive surveillance become the new normal?\\nDepuis les révélations de juillet\\xa02021, le feuilleton de la surveillance généralisée semble avoir plus de retournements de situation, de suspenses improbables et de complots qu’une très mauvaise série à rebondissements.\\nRésumons. Les gouvernements européens, et pas seulement en Pologne et en Hongrie, surveillent leurs opposants politiques, les activistes et les journalistes de leur pays. Ces gouvernements sont eux-mêmes surveillés par des gouvernements souvent autoritaires, hors de l’Union européenne, qui surveillent en même temps les opposants, les activistes et les journalistes, dans nos pays comme dans les leurs. \\nAlors, quand on est politique, activiste et/ou journaliste, doit-on considérer cela normal d’être surveillé constamment? Comme la grenouille dans l’eau qui devient bouillante, sommes-nous en train de nous habituer à être espionnés et tracés continuellement dans nos vies quotidiennes? À travers l’Europe, des technologies de surveillance intrusives s’infiltrent dans tous les aspects de nos vies. Normaliser cette surveillance, c’est pourtant abandonner notre droit à la vie privée, à la dignité, à la liberté. Des droits fondamentaux!\\n\\n36, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-05-04, EN, The case of Osman Kavala in Turkey, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-05-04-INT-3-311-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, was the trial of Osman Kavala and his co—defendants the last chance for justice in Turkey? We know that there are so many victims of the repressive regime in Turkey, but the case of Osman Kavala is one of the most unjust of all. This businessperson and human rights advocate was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of release. But since the very first day he was imprisoned four and a half years ago, there have never been any grounds for his detention. He is perceived as a threat by the authoritarian regime. Acquitted then charged again, he has never left prison. They just decided to persecute him. \\nHis seven colleagues have also been sentenced to eighteen years in prison. They represent a patchwork of Turkish society: lawyers, publishers, architects, academics, filmmakers, journalists, civil rights defenders. Only the impression that these people could possibly be one day, dissidents, was enough to seal their fate. Osman Kavala and his colleagues have been branded enemies of the state and unlawfully imprisoned for trying to build a more civil, just society in a country where respect for fundamental rights continues to deteriorate.\\n\\n40, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-04-06, EN, Cooperation and similarities between the Putin regime and extreme right and separatist movements in Europe (topical debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-04-06-INT-3-178-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – There is a city where extreme-right parties lie together and where the Russia-led International Investment Bank has recently moved its headquarters. This city is Budapest.\\nMarine Le Pen, Éric Zemmour, VOX Party leaders and others have often taken pilgrimages there. In March 2021, Viktor Orbán called for the creation of a new European right-wing force for his type of people. Those who he says want to protect their families and homelands. There is a country where Zelinskyy is portrayed as an enemy, where doubts are publicly voiced about Russian responsibility in the invasion of Ukraine and where Ukraine’s suffering does not evoke that much empathy.\\nThis country is Hungary, and there is a government who does not protect European and national information from Western spying. Indeed, Hungarian diplomacy has practically become an open book for Moscow through the hacking of the Fidesz Ministry of Foreign Affairs network, which the government had direct knowledge of, but failed to alert their European counterparts.\\nBudapest could become the entry point for Russian disinformation, Russian money and the connecting thread between extreme-right organisations. \\n\\n42, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2022-03-08, EN, Foreign interference in all democratic processes in the EU (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-08-INT-2-039-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, we are becoming more and more concerned about foreign interference in our electoral process. We now fear the destructive capacity of fake news on security issues, health matters, our political leaders. But for years and years, there has been disinformation targeting one very specific topic, women’s rights. And it is a mistake that this has not been considered to be a serious problem, because gendered disinformation not only has the power to severely harm women’s lives, but it is also a clear and constant attack on the foundations of our societies. \\nRussia is today spreading lies about the Ukrainian people, the war, Europe’s involvement, but Russia has long taken an active role in promoting dangerous disinformation based on so-called ‘traditional’ narratives. This is meant to fuel hate against women, minorities, LGBTI people, both online and offline. These mobilisations against us, all across Europe. We see financing from anti-gender groups within the EU, from US Christian right—wing groups and Russian oligarchs, and do not be mistaken, this is part of a broader political strategy to undermine equal participation in our democracy, the European Union itself, the world we want to live in; a world of emancipation, gender equality, freedom and fundamental rights.\\nIt is a strategy to put each and every one of us in a box where we are to stay for all our lives and accept an authoritarian, ultraconservative way of life. They first attack women, LGBTI people, Muslims, people of colour, all minorities. But in the end, once they have created threats that silence all of these people, they come for the others. \\n\\n46, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-12-14, EN, Digital Markets Act (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-14-INT-2-051-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, we do not want our online experiences to be dictated by the unfair practices of a handful of big tech companies. Their current dominance means that what we see online, who we interact with, and how our data is or isn’t protected is mostly controlled by a group of profit—driven companies, many being bigger in size than European countries.\\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) could have gone further but still, as it stands, this report will allow us to take back control and strive for more democracy online. We will be able to choose which apps we install on our devices, but mostly it will stop gatekeepers from secretly reusing people’s data across their different services. We Greens/EFA /Pirates have called for the protection of users throughout the process. Fundamental rights must continue to be the priority.\\n\\n47, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-12-13, EN, Combating gender-based violence: cyberviolence (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-13-INT-1-049-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr\\xa0President, a woman threatened online is in danger. If she’s a journalist, a politician, an activist, the consequences could be terrible. Young girls can be assaulted for days and weeks without an end in sight, and this is true for all victims of gender-based online violence. This is why some women, LGBTI+ people and minority people have ultimately left the online space to flee this discrimination. \\nBut this is not a solution. We cannot expect people to leave so that the problem no longer exists. It would be dangerous to put control in the hands of just a few big tech companies. This would let them define what we mean by ‘hate’. It would let them decide on the meaning of freedom of speech, who are the most vulnerable users and who are the ones to be silenced. \\nWhat we need to happen has already taken place in the past. I am referring to the establishment of ground rules to make up a comprehensive system, a set of legal, governmental and societal tools, for a completely new space. In only the last 10\\xa0years, the online space has completely transformed many aspects of our societies. To meet these challenges, we need clearly defined laws, including pragmatic concrete measures, as well as education and training for law enforcement and better implementation. We need police and justice to know what they are dealing with. We need culture and society to be involved. This will require a lot of resources. But this money, it exists – it’s already there in these big companies. It just needs to be redirected to better support and protect users online. \\nBig companies cannot be allowed to continue using this business model, which reserves limited resources for these important measures. If we cannot address this, we run the risk of leaving machines and non-transparent algorithms with the implicit bias to continue censoring some people, while targeting others.\\n\\n49, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-11-25, EN, The International Day of Elimination of Violence Against Women and the State of play on the ratification of the Istanbul Convention (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-25-INT-4-028-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, when an increasing number of countries decide to attack the Istanbul Convention and to use disinformation in order to undermine the protection of women and LGBTI people, the EU and its institutions must more than ever be exemplary and ambitious, not only by reaffirming our shared values on equality and fundamental rights but also by using the tools that we have to react when they are under attack, and that we under-use systematically on these sorts of topics.\\nIn May 2020, the Hungarian Parliament rejected the ratification of the Istanbul Convention under the pretext that it promotes destructive gender ideologies and illegal migration. At the same moment, civil society organisations reported an alarming increase of reports of domestic violence during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Today it is not even possible to understand the extent of gender-based violence in Hungary, as the government simply does not collect data on this issue. Instead of properly funding services for victims of gender-based violence and enacting adequate legislation to eradicate gender-based violence, the Hungarian Government spends its energy in rejecting any international or EU text excluding the word gender.\\nEvery time people talk about not ratifying the Istanbul Convention but fighting anyway, every time they want to protect some women but not others, every time they avoid the word ‘gender’, the word ‘intersectionality’, the word ‘minorities’, they do not really want to act. They are just using this. And every time they use also the word ‘ideology’, they are just using the combat of women to use their own purpose, and they’re not doing anything.\\n\\n50, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-10-21, EN, The outcome of the Western Balkans summit (continuation of debate) (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-21-INT-4-046-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, we are disappointed with the outcome of the Western Balkans Summit, but we also continue to be disappointed by the repeated lack of action on rule of law failings in the region. In Serbia, for example, the Commission is not just turning a blind eye, but pushing their candidacy forward and upgrading to a country-specific assessment in spite of the clear lack of progress in that state and in spite of the authoritarian actions of its government.\\nJust a few weeks ago, Politico called Hungarian Commissioner Olivér Várhelyi ‘the Voldemort of enlargement’, describing his actions as having a long-term damaging impact on the EU-Western Balkans relationship. \\nIn the mean time, media freedom in Serbia continues to nosedive. The authorities attempted to discreetly push through a draft law permitting the use of biometric mass surveillance, and there is still a dangerously high level of air pollution caused by coal plants in the region, and when people protest, they are repressed. \\nSerbia’s leadership does not want to respect EU values and fundamental rights for citizens. They have made this very clear in their candidacy process. So, once they become a Member State, they will just follow the path of the Hungarian and Polish governments. We do not want the Serbian citizens to be second-rung European citizens; we want them to be full European citizens and we can do that if we make our conditions stronger when we talk to the Serbian Government. \\nWith new elections next year in Serbia, there is a chance for change. Now is also the time for us to engage in dialogue with citizens, civil society and independent media in the region. While this summit may not have provided the hope needed for citizens in these neighbourhood countries, we are now at a crossroads in the EU-Western Balkans relationship. If EU leaders are really committed to the European perspective in the region, when can we expect the Commission to do something about the rule of law and democratic backsliding in these countries?\\n\\n53, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-10-06, EN, The state of play on the submitted RRF recovery plans awaiting approval (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-06-INT-3-247-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, on 27\\xa0April 2021, a new law was adopted in Hungary. It created a legal framework for public interest trusts performing public duties. More and more public services are being transferred. The boards of these trusts include current ministers and state secretaries. Public assets are being donated to private entities, and opacity will prevent any scrutiny on the use of the budget in these foundations. These trusts do not need to apply rules of public procurement. This is happening in a context where access to public information in Hungary has become near to impossible and in a Member State which has a hugely sad record of corruption in the European Union. \\nWe fail to understand why this is not raising concern about how European money will be channelled into these structures. Is this a conscious strategy from the Hungarian Government to transform public institutions into opaque structures? If the European Commission approves the Hungarian Recovery and Resilience Plan, billions of euros could disappear into this opaque system.\\n\\n56, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-07-07, EN, Breaches of EU law and of the rights of LGBTIQ citizens in Hungary as a result of the adopted legal changes in the Hungarian Parliament - The outcome of 22 June hearings under Article 7(1) of the TEU regarding Poland and Hungary (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-07-07-INT-3-088-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, I think this will follow on well after Guy\\xa0Verhofstadt’s speaking time.\\nI really fail to understand how it is possible that the situation in Hungary cannot be dealt with in a calm, straightforward, consistent and legitimate way with the tools we have, and they are efficient. The Article 7 procedure needs to be pursued. It needs a new set of hearings during the Slovenian Presidency, and it needs recommendations during the French Presidency. Then, if at the end of 2022, rule of law is not back in Hungary, we will need to follow up and to think about sanctions and maybe we will need to think about withdrawing voting rights, because that is what happens when a Member steps out of democracy. It cannot still have a say in an overall democratic, crucial organisation.\\nWe need Hungary’s recovery plan to be scrutinised more than the others; not because we want to punish the Hungarian Government by this means for all the outrageous laws that they’ve been making for a decade. No, simply because we know we have a huge problem of corruption in Hungary.\\nI’m not inventing it. The Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), academic research and your own internal assessment in the Commission are saying it. The public procurements are fake. There’s no transparency on how the EU money is used, and we know that there is a risk that the final beneficiary will not get the funds. So it’s simple. Then we will need to activate the EU rule of law mechanism regulation about all the other European money that goes to Hungary because, there again, we have serious doubts. \\n(Applause)\\n\\n59, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-05-20, EN, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (\"Schrems II\") - Case C-311/18 - The adequate protection of personal data by the United Kingdom (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-05-20-INT-4-016-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr\\xa0President, what have we learned from the Schrems judgment? Given that the Commission is ready to hand the United Kingdom an adequacy decision in a too hasty way, we could think the European Union has learned nothing. But we should know better. \\nThe Privacy Shield was invalidated at the European Court of Justice because of the mass surveillance practices used by the US Government, and thanks to the 2013 revelations by Edward Snowden we are well aware now that the UK Government uses similar mass surveillance devices, and it should be obvious to everyone that mass surveillance – indiscriminate mass surveillance – is a huge threat to our fundamental rights. \\nEuropean citizens have the right to not be considered first as criminals by their governments. European citizens have the right to protect their very personal and sensitive information. In concrete life would it be possible to have someone knocking at your door every five minutes trying to sell you something or make you do something, complete strangers that know everything about you, not only where you went, what you did, who you met, who are your relatives, but very intimate things – your tastes, your habits, your wishes, your frustrations, your dreams, your angers, your joys. \\nIt seems that some lobbies, and maybe some people in the Commission, want to bargain these fundamental rights. And this is not in the interest of citizens, but neither of business, because good business is done with good democratic rules and stability and good faith. \\nThere has been legal uncertainty for too long, there have been various attempts at prioritising hazardous data flows for too long. First, with the US, now with the UK, but soon with third countries which the UK Government will go into trade with, not respecting any of our rules and accepting to share data with no rules. We are at serious risk of sharing personal European citizens’ data everywhere in the world, even with authoritarian countries.\\n\\n61, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-04-27, EN, The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement - The outcome of EU-UK negotiations (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-04-27-INT-2-046-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, a British citizens’ organisation once told me that there is more interest in commodities, fish and trucks, than people. Citizens were never the core issue of this story. There were talks on taking sovereignty back, but we all know it was in fact about getting power back again on the business rules, and it then became, for the European Union, about protecting and strengthening its own market.\\nArticle\\xa050 did not allow the EU to come in front of those living in the UK, to fight for what was at stake and defend its concept of European citizenship. Once Brexit started, there was no consultation ever again on the outcomes and the challenges, and in the future it is not planned that citizens will be part of the monitoring. All this time, the EU considered that it was not its place to address the citizens directly, and the UK chose not to. But now citizens are paying a high price. In the UK, EU citizens will be selected to see who is worth staying. Administrative failures are preventing some people from registering and others have registered months ago but get no news and, in the end, there will be no paper document to prove their status. \\nIn Northern Ireland, the EU was not given the authorisation to implement a permanent representation so, there again, in a context of tensions boiling over and uncertainty, the EU renounces fulfilling its responsibility to the inhabitants of Northern Ireland. In the EU, UK citizens will face different situations. Member States have not got the same rules and will not give the same rights. Students will not get scholarships. Some people are at risk of losing jobs and houses because of problems with their residence permit. And what about all of those the Member States are not managing to reach? The vulnerable and the precarious ones. Will they be near-to-stateless people in the European Union tomorrow? And where is the European one—stop—shop with enough resources to help all of these people to go through the next years? \\n\\n63, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-03-10, EN, Government attempts to silence free media in Poland, Hungary and Slovenia (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-10-INT-3-143-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, Népszabadság, 1956—2016 – a newspaper bought by a friend of Viktor Orbán, then shut down; Index.hu, 1995–2020 – a news website bought by a friend of Viktor Orbán. Staff were fired or pushed to resign, they then created Telex.hu; Klubradio, 1999–2021 – radio frequency was not given by the government this year, they went on the internet. We could speak about Origo, the first newspaper bought by a friend of Viktor Orbán in 2014, which changed dramatically and radically its editorial line to become 100% pro—government without any nuances – like all the other media bought by friends of Viktor Orbán these last years.\\nThe obituary of independent media in Hungary is getting longer every year. There are no arrests of journalists in that Member State, but every means is being employed by the Fidesz government to suppress purely and simply media freedom and media pluralism. Forced closures, media capture, state aid abuse, channelling state advertising only to pro—government media, smear campaigns against journalists and the creation of a media council which regulates everything is totally non-transparent and completely in the hands of the government. \\nThis is not a rule of law concern. This is a core issue of the European Union. This is the free market. This is distortion of fair competition and a misuse of European money. This is our job.\\n(Applause) \\n\\n64, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-02-10, EN, Democratic scrutiny of social media and the protection of fundamental rights (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-02-10-INT-3-182-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, the NGO AlgorithmWatch reports that existing transparency tools have failed. Our laws are not yet fit for purpose in the digital world.

What we need most here is transparency of algorithm, to hold platforms accountable for the impact on democratic processes and to scrutinise their actions.\\nWe need transparency of algorithm to share the data with researchers, for example, at the new European Digital Media Observatory. We need transparency of algorithm to fight disinformation, and we need transparency to help us understand how online spaces have become hotbeds of systemic inequality and discrimination.\\nWomen and minorities are deserting the online space more and more often, after extremely violent experiences.

Algorithms have been overwhelmingly designed by white men. Amazon has discovered that one of the algorithms they were using to hire staff was simply penalising all female candidates. Facial recognition systems are dramatically and dangerously discriminatory because they are built out of data from white men’s faces. So if you present these tools with non—white or female features they will simply get all confused and will mistake one woman for another.\\nNeutrality of technology is a sad fairy tale, a nasty one, and if we do decide to stay ignorant to these biases, the digital world will simply reproduce and amplify all the discrimination, injustices and sadness we are fighting against elsewhere. So we need public policies to prevent this from happening.\\n\\n67, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2021-01-20, EN, Presentation of the programme of activities of the Portuguese Presidency (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-01-20-INT-3-155-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, I have been a Member of this Parliament for 18 months and I already sound like a broken record.\\nEvery start of a semester I request for my Group one minute of speaking time to address the new Presidency and to inquire what will you do about the situation in Poland? What will you do about the situation in Hungary? What will you do about these two Article\\xa07 procedures that the Council seems to be shying away from, reeling away from, even. \\nMeanwhile, democratic life in these two countries is getting worse and worse, and some freedoms just do not exist anymore for those citizens that the Council does not seem to find equal to the other European people. \\nWe need you to act. Will you be in the courageous camp? I remember the Finnish Presidency.

Significant progress has been made on the Northern Ireland Protocol, on citizens’ rights and on the level playing field. Ensuring peace and a diplomatic link with Northern Ireland now seems possible. Ensuring there are standards – high, democratic, environmental, social standards – in our trading and cooperation with the UK is still a priority. But time is ticking and we no longer have the possibility for scrutiny before 31\\xa0December, so we cannot fulfil our duty as Members of this Parliament. \\nRunning down the clock should not be an effective negotiation tactic. We are seriously endangering our future relationship with the UK if we accept a last—minute deal and if we submit ourselves to this shameful UK government’s strategy of delaying talks since one year ago. There cannot be blind trust. We are here to protect the rights of citizens, both in the EU and the UK.\\nLet’s take the example of data protection. We already know that Facebook is planning to shift the oversight of data belonging to British users from Ireland to the USA. Once again, this UK government has a very problematic record on data protection aspects. So we cannot sign an agreement with them, an adequacy agreement, with no further scrutiny. We need at least a technical extension, a six—week—minimum scrutiny period, written into any deal that would be made.\\n\\n71, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2020-11-25, EN, Hungarian interference in the media in Slovenia and North Macedonia (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-11-25-INT-3-151-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, the Commission has not taken any concrete measures to stop the Hungarian Government from pressuring independent media. Yet, at the same time, this Commission officially states – and it’s a good thing – that media pluralism is a fundamental pillar of democracy. Sadly, as this debate shows, the trend we’ve seen in Hungary is now spreading to other countries. And we know the story: the Hungarian Government likes to say that there are no journalists imprisoned in Hungary, but suffocating the media is enough to kill freedom of expression. It also allows oligarchs to cherry pick media sources, which then ultimately get leaders elected who are more complacent.\\nThe European Commission has still not responded to two complaints from 2016 and 2018 on the abuse of State aid and State advertisement by the Hungarian Government, leading to the distortion of the media market. The concentration of media ownership should be taken seriously and urgently addressed by the European Commission if we want to ensure democracy and truly fight corruption.\\n\\n73, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2020-10-19, EN, Digital Services Act: Improving the functioning of the Single Market - Digital Services Act: adapting commercial and civil law rules for commercial entities operating online - Digital Services Act and fundamental rights issues posed - Framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies - Civil liability regime for artificial intelligence - Intellectual property rights for the development of artificial intelligence technologies (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-10-19-INT-1-081-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr President, in this joint debate, we have covered a broad range of subjects, but I will emphasise how much artificial intelligence has an impact on structural inequalities in our societies. \\nWe ask for legislation guided by strong ethical principles with the protection of citizens and the environment as a priority. Regulation must address racial and gender-based discrimination. Such systems need to be subject to constant review and analysis. Further research is needed on the way in which algorithms perpetuate harmful biases. When content is considered problematic or dangerous, who decides how it’s removed from platforms? We are particularly concerned that introducing a separate category of legal but harmful context will lead to online censorship.\\nThe text does not contain clear enough language on upload filters. Even more worrying is the call for an electronic identification scheme that paves the way for master variance. This is a huge issue.\\nMost of all, we must reiterate the importance of digital education. Only by equipping citizens with facts and enabling them to identify disinformation and misinformation can we make sure that we have an inclusive digital transformation.\\n\\n75, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2020-10-05, EN, The rule of law and fundamental rights in Bulgaria (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-10-05-INT-1-138-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, addressing you today on the state of corruption and the rule of law in Bulgaria, I have a feeling of déjà vu. We have already discussed upholding democracy and fighting corruption while tens of thousands of EU citizens protest on the streets. Yet again, we are noting with concern the high level of corruption, the degradation of judicial independence and the lack of media freedom in an EU Member State. Yet again, our response to their continued cries for support remains too weak, too little and too late. \\nCommissioners, we have complimented you, and we want to compliment you, on the quality of the annual rule of law report. It seems to me that we have the same long-term priorities. However, in order to demonstrate that we are fully committed to the rule of law right now, we need to see concrete action resulting from this exercise. We cannot fight an open fire only with an inventory of what started the fire. Have we not learned anything from the cases of Hungary and Poland? \\nThe annual report just published shows significant deficiencies in Bulgaria across a number of areas, but most notably in the use of public funds. The Commission needs to act on these findings. As a bare minimum we need to maintain the cooperation and verification mechanism, and on this we disagree with the Commission because no other instrument exists at the moment to challenge the situation and fight the corruption. \\n\\n79, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2020-05-14, EN, Emergency Legislation in Hungary and its impact on the Rule of Law and fundamental rights (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-05-14-INT-2-022-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Ms Jourová, the Commission, the Parliament has been scrutinising the different exceptional rules put in place by many Member States during this crisis, and they all have in common that they have frozen, for a short period, some of our fundamental rights and liberties – one of them being the essence of this European Union, freedom of movement. But one government, and only one, in Hungary, has framed its state of urgency with no ‘sunset’ clause.\\nToday, in Hungary, the government has extensive powers with no clear definition and for an indefinite time. Let us not be mistaken. This has no necessity efficiency-wise. This has no sanitary basis. And this is turning its back on democracy.\\nWe all know what has happened in Hungary for 10 years. Even more this last year and even more these last weeks. We are fully documented. Files are piling up on your desk, on my desk, as a rapporteur, on the desks of many people in this Parliament, of civil servants, in each of our institutions, in permanent representations. They are all aware; time of awareness has gone. We have our eyes wide open. We know about the attacks against freedom of the media. We know about the continuous judicial reform. We know about the discriminatory measures.\\nWe know that today in Hungary you can have five years of imprisonment because the government considers you have spread fake news. We all know that yesterday one man was taken into custody for an opinion he posted on Facebook. Freedom of thinking is under threat now in Hungary. We know that it is easier to live in Hungary if you are male, if you’re white and if you don’t question the government.\\nWhy, then, do your legal services in the Commission feel, guess, that there is no legal ground for infringement? Why then do Member States make a very clear statement without spelling out loudly the name we are talking about. There are gradual, very clear rules that can help us for a resolution under Article 7. These tools exist. Why are we not using them enough?\\nWe want Hungarian citizens to stay European citizens, but we do not want them to be second-rate citizens with not exactly the same rights as the other European citizens.\\n\\n80, Gwendoline DELBOS-CORFIELD, 2020-01-29, EN, Withdrawal Agreement of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-01-29-INT-1-115-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (Verts/ALE).   – Madam President, it is important to remember that the majority of women and young people of the UK voted to stay in the European Union. 75% of 18-24-year-olds voted to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union. More specifically, 80% of women between the ages of 18 and 24 were against Brexit, and there is a reason for that.\\nThe European Union protects women’s rights to a great extent. Will the UK, out of Europe, give the same guarantees? The Scots, the northern Irish, the Welsh, by their citizens’ votes and also, these last two years, by their national parliaments have continued to express their attachment to the European Union. They now find themselves on the sidelines. The choices of these regional assemblies are not heard, and this is one of the major problems of Brexit. But there is another concern, a very strong one. Great Britain today is a country with a very deregulated economy and a very unequal society. European directives on workers’ rights were the last bulwark for the most vulnerable part: women, minorities and young people.\\nWe Greens, regionalists and pirates will pay close attention to the situation of citizens’ rights in the aftermath. We are committed to protecting the rights of all Europeans living in Britain and British people living in the rest of Europe.\\n\\n1, Pascal CANFIN, 2023-11-09, EN, European environmental economic accounts: new modules (A9-0296/2023 - Pascal Canfin)  (vote), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-11-09-INT-2-083-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pascal Canfin,  rapporteur. – Yes, colleagues, I just have the pleasure to request the referral back to committee for interinstitutional negotiations, as a surprise, following Rule 59(4). \\n\\n12, Pascal CANFIN, 2022-06-08, EN, Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System for aviation (A9-0155/2022 - Sunčana Glavak)  (vote), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-08-INT-3-100-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Pascal Canfin,  président de la commission de l\\'environnement. – Madam President, so again I think we all share the fact that we need to vote consistent text. These ones, the two on aviation and CORSIA, are a package which is not connected to three first texts. So the rapporteur and the negotiating team agrees on the fact that we can go ahead and proceed today with these two texts on CORSIA ETS aviation that are disconnected of substance from the three texts that we parked and sent back to ENVI.\\n\\n87, Laura FERRARA, 2020-10-05, EN, The establishment of an EU Mechanism on Democracy, the Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2020-10-05-INT-1-041-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Katarina Barley,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam President, 80% of Europeans think that the rule of law has great importance and that it should be enforced in the European Union. The European Parliament has being calling for such monitoring for a long time now. Already in 2016 we delivered a report on that matter and since then the situation in the Member States has not become any better. \\nNow we have the report of the Commission – thank you very much for it. We still believe that our report – thank you to Michal Šimečka and the other shadows – goes further, especially in scope but also concerning independent experts and an automatic reaction to the breaches. Still, we are happy that this report is here and we are also happy with the way it has been presented, using very clear language. It is good because now we can compare, and as for the argument of ‘well, here we do the same as this country and that country’, we can now see the bigger picture. And you have to look at all of it. \\nAs for the key questions – ‘do you, as a government, want to be controlled?’ ‘Do you believe that criticism is something positive that brings you further in democracy?’ – I am deeply convinced that we can compromise on everything – on posts, on persons, on money, on budget, on everything – but we can never compromise on our core values. We have to be very clear on this. We have the values in the treaty. We have the European Court of Justice that rules on it and there we are not willing to compromise on anything. \\n(Applause)\\n\\n15, Francesca DONATO, 2022-11-23, EN, Amending Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 of 17 December 2020 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 - Amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 as regards the establishment of a diversified funding strategy as a general borrowing method - \\'Macro-Financial Assistance+\\' instrument for providing support to Ukraine for 2023 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-11-23-INT-3-250-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Francesca Donato (NI).   – Mr President, the EU has taken too many financial risks on Ukraine. That is what the European Court of Auditors has stated in its last report on European Union budget. In 2022 the Union has committed EUR\\xa07.2 billion of loans to Ukraine. European borrowing operations funding this support involve serious risks: Ukraine’s default first, fraud and misuse of money as the second.\\nNobody knows how the war in Ukraine will end, and if in the future the country will be able to repay its long—term loans. The IMF predictions for Ukrainian economy are baleful. In case of default there is not enough room in the budget of EU to absorb losses if Member States refuse to step in. In such a case, massive cuts to all EU programmes will be unavoidable.\\nNevertheless, the Commission now is proposing an MFA+ instrument to provide Ukraine for 2023 with up to EUR\\xa018 billion in loans in 12 months. If the Commission wants to gamble, let us not forget that is handling taxpayers’ money, and in case of losses, we all will be held accountable, not the Commission.\\n\\n17, Francesca DONATO, 2022-10-19, EN, Preparation of the European Council meeting of 20-21 October 2022 (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-035-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Francesca Donato (NI).   – Madam President, (start of speech off microphone) meeting the Council will reaffirm the EU military, humanitarian and financial assistance to Ukraine. The Commission could propose a more structural solution by granting Ukraine EUR 1.5 billion per month in 2023.\\nAs for military aid, the EU has so far provided EUR\\xa02.5 billion to Ukraine and the Foreign Affairs Council a few days ago agreed an additional EUR 500 million and a new EU military assistance mission for Ukraine with an envelope of EUR 106 million. How will this new expenditure be justified in front of the European Court of Auditors, which in its last audit report has issued an adverse opinion on EU budget expenditure, and on this precise chapter explicitly recommends the Commission to take appropriate action to reduce outstanding commitments in the long term?\\nMoreover, after adopting eight packages of sanctions on Russia, the European Council wishes to introduce additional sanctions that, as previous ones did, will just heavily harm EU citizens and assets. At the same time, the only concrete measures so far introduced to contain high energy prices is just rationing to curb demand, which will lead to further downturn in economic dynamics.\\nWe are on the edge of an abyss. Shall we dive into it to understand that it will kill us?\\n\\n19, Francesca DONATO, 2022-10-17, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-17-INT-1-035-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Francesca Donato (NI).   – Madam President, I oppose myself to this request because I think that, on the basis of the facts that we have and that we know, labelling the Russian Federation as a state who supports terrorism is arbitrary.\\nWe could do the same thing against Ukraine after the US have assessed that the murder of Darya Dugina has been made by Ukrainian secret services, and that is no doubt a terrorist assault. So if we do want to label some states for terrorism, that would be ones that we could label like at least formally.\\n\\n22, Francesca DONATO, 2022-07-06, EN, The relations of the Russian government and diplomatic network with parties of extremist, populist, anti-European and certain other European political parties in the context of the war (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-07-06-INT-3-277-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Francesca Donato (NI).   – Madam\\xa0President, I am literally shocked by what I’ve heard here today. Are you really proposing to restrict the political activity of parties which democratically represent European citizens in their national dimension? Since when has the EU taken over, by totalitarian control, the political line of Member States’ national parties?\\nWhat we are discussing today is a dangerous and disturbing drift towards a deeply antidemocratic scenario with the false claim of protecting democracy. But doing this, we not only repress freedom of expression and freedom of opinion, but we deny the fundamental principle of democratic representation. If national governments don’t formally declare a state of war with Russia, there is no reason and no legal basis to forbid or restrict any political diplomatic relationship at the national level with Russian interlocutors.\\nThe majority of Italian people do not support the ban to commercial, energetic and political relationship with Russia, and they definitely have the right to be represented in any field of political action. That’s it.\\n\\n24, Thierry MARIANI, 2023-06-14, EN, Investigation of the use of Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware - Investigation of the use of Pegasus and equivalent surveillance spyware (draft recommendation) (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-06-14-INT-3-180-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Thierry Mariani (ID),  blue-card answer. – I wasn’t in your committee. Sorry. But I think the problem for the European Union is just the weak. Because we are strong with the weak people and weak with the strong State. You have a new example.

Nothing. \\n\\n13, Piernicola PEDICINI, 2022-10-19, EN, Lukashenka regime\\'s active role in the war against Ukraine (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-10-19-INT-3-358-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Piernicola Pedicini (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, Russia takes Crimea, and Ukraine attacks Donbas; Russia invades Ukraine and the USA and Europe send weapons to Ukraine, so Ukraine takes back Donbas, but Russia asks Belarus for help and Belarus deploys its armies on the border, so NATO does military exercises in the war area and Russia makes possible the use of nuclear weapons. Where are we going to? This is the problem. This is the question I have. \\nThis plenary should represent European people, and the European people outside this room don’t want this escalation. But I didn’t listen to anyone making a proposal to stop the war, apart from someone. So my final question is, who does this plenary actually represent?\\n\\n18, Herbert DORFMANN, 2023-05-08, EN, Order of business, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2023-05-08-INT-1-025-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Herbert Dorfmann,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, colleagues, it was the EPP Group that insisted last week on a key debate on agriculture. Our proposal was to stress the need to listen and to respect farmers in shaping EU policies. But, The Left group as well as the Renew Group could not accept the concept of listening and respect farmers. \\nAs a result, the title of the key debate on agriculture as it now stands on the agenda, risks to change fundamentally the initial idea of the debate. Of course, our farmers play an important role in the green transition and the resilience of the sector, and there is hardly, I think, an economic sector like agriculture that adapted and modernised so dramatically and drastically over the past decade as in the context of the Green Deal and the current economic challenges. \\nHowever, let us not give the impression that the main role of our farmers would be to enable the green transition. We have had countless debates in this Chamber on the need to be ambitious in addressing climate change. By fully respecting the objectives of the EU Fit for 55 agenda, it must be clear that our farmers are crucial for our food security and for sustaining our rural areas. \\nThe EPP Group therefore believes it’s high time to have a debate which expresses this respect to the role of farmers and the willingness to listen to them. So we want to achieve this objective together with farmers and not imposing on them our objectives. \\nTherefore, the PPE Group moves the request to change the title as follows ‘Listening to and respecting farmers as enablers of the green transition and a resilient agricultural sector’.\\n\\n26, Alessandra MORETTI, 2022-03-10, EN, Announcement of voting results, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-10-INT-4-007-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Alessandra Moretti,  deputising for the rapporteur. – Mr President, following the vote on the amendments, on behalf of the rapporteur Ms\\xa0Bonafè, I would like to request referral back to committee pursuant to Rule 59(4), in order to start interinstitutional negotiations.\\n'"

I think it’s a very good improvement. It will be a good change for a European Union that will be more and more united and able to offer European parties with a real system where our heads of the lists can be our Spitzenkandidaten to lead our fight for a more political and so stronger European Commission.

Along with training more healthcare staff and supporting research, the EU4Health programme presents a leap forward in the health of our citizens. The pandemic exposed the vulnerability of our healthcare systems as we experienced care disruptions, medical shortages, health system inadequacy, and insufficient and unequal access to healthcare. So, there is a need for a common health policy that allows EU countries to properly cooperate and coordinate in times of crisis and to strengthen our capacity to respond to new cross-border health threats. \\nDuring the early stages of the pandemic especially, Europe reckoned with shortages in necessary medical supplies and medicines due to disruption and bottlenecks in global supply chains. We all agree that we can no longer have such dependence on one or two countries in key markets. To do this, we must help manufacture and produce more medicines in Europe, and by so doing, we will strengthen the Union to the benefit of all our citizens. And as our very dear Commissioner said in her opening remarks, with EUR\\xa05.1 billion, a lot can be achieved – 12 times more than the previous mandate. A good news story.\\n\\n3, Ignazio CORRAO, 2022-12-13, EN, Renewable Energy, Energy Performance of Buildings and Energy Efficiency Directives: amendments (REPowerEU) (continuation of debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-12-13-INT-2-038-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Madam\\xa0President, good morning Mr\\xa0Executive Vice—President. Yesterday, a historic scientific breakthrough was announced. In ten years, nuclear fusion might power a completely decarbonised energy system. But we are still talking about ten years at least.\\nWhat do we do until then? Shall we keep growing our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign countries that produce them? Doesn’t seem very wise. Shall we keep pouring water on conventional nuclear plants and sweep their waste under the rug?\\nThe solution in the meanwhile is investing in solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps. This is the cheapest and fastest way to decarbonise the energy system now. And we need to accelerate because the climate crisis does not wait for administrative procedures to be done. Citizens are on our side, on this as long as we let them be part of the process and aid their advantage on the process, on bills, for example, and don’t impose choices on them.\\nCitizens are actually the power that our renewable energy system is built on.\\n\\n4, Ignazio CORRAO, 2022-06-23, EN, Gas storage (debate), https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-06-23-INT-2-021-0000_EN.html, \\xa0\\xa0Ignazio Corrao (Verts/ALE).   – Mr\\xa0President, at the end, we reached a good compromise in the storage regulation in case of emergency as the scope to protect our citizens and households. However, we could do more with the ban on Russian gas, which should not be used to fill up our storage facilities. I welcome the fact that energy efficiency has become part of the security of gas supply policy and the filling target mechanism, even if we are still far away from a real policy that would prioritise energy efficiency, savings and renewables. \\nWe should clearly understand that the disagreement is temporary because of the war and a geopolitical moment.', start_char_idx=100445, end_char_idx=104846, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6661063692105318),\n",
