# meps-text-mining

The objective of this project is the analysis of Member of European Parliaments work.

After scraping the parliamentary interventions of MEPS, I'm interested in finding out how
frequent each MP or group give contributions, which topics are more frequent and what 
sentiment is attached to those topics.

The project uses ChatGPT for text analysis.
